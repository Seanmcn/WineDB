This second wine was the complete opposite, with super-restrained flavours hiding behind a shield of acid and maybe just a hint of texture. Everyone and I thought this was a Muscadet, which is a Loire wine made from the\u00a0super-neutral Melon de Bourgogne grape. The grape is moulded into a textured and yeasty wine by processes involving storing the wine over fine lees (dead yeast cells), so all of it made sense, and almost everyone thought this was one of acceptable to good quality \u2013 lifeless but\u00a0satisfactory. So it turns out this was a 63-dollar wine from a well-reputed producer. This shocked everyone in the class, and my request to revisit the wine for a second pour was mirrored by everyone else. It was just so neutral \u2013 a dumb phase, perhaps, requiring a bit of age to open up, plus, possibly,\u00a0a relatively tougher vintage which shrouded the wine from being its usual self. There was some texture and a longer finish that bumped up the quality, according to instructor, and maybe the acid was unbalanced in this case, which, like the vintage, veiled the wine from its true elements.

Even though this was a semi-blind flight, even someone new to wine could instantly smell the grassiness that was a Sauvignon Blanc. It\u2019s a trendy grape right now along with Pinot Grigio, leaving Chardonnay and Riesling in the background \u2013 couple this with summer, and it\u2019s a grape that produces wines that can fly off the shelves. Sauvignon Blanc isn\u2019t a \u201cserious\u201d grape. It hardly ever ages, its character is dominated by primary aromas, and much like Gewurztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc is both pronounced in its character and is usually unmistakeable in its aromas, but with more mouthwatering acidity than Gew. Although I preach its distinctiveness, it has a range of emotion, from the restrained gunflint versions in the Loire, the oaked versions in California, and the greenness more expressed as stewed bell pepper and jalape\u00f1o combined with lower acidity in areas like Chile. So we come across this wine, and despite the fact that the class can often be split on identifying wines, I would say that the majority of the class guessed that this was from New Zealand. Not Chile, we said: too lean, green, and bright. And not Sancerre, either: too fruity. A wine like this was from the New World, and from a cool climate at that. It was a bit of a surprise to find out that this was from none other than Sancerre. The searing acid makes much more sense here \u2013 New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is apparently softer in its structure. But the fruitiness is perhaps a response to consumers, who find that outward flamboyant style to be popular. Enter a modern style of Sancerre. I love fresh Sauvignon Blanc on a hot day, and its disappointing when you find one with nothing but at least med+ levels of acid. Sancerre can perhaps be reliable in that sense, but if only these wines weren\u2019t so expensive.

In this case, though, we have a classic Loire Sauvignon Blanc \u2013 perhaps as a reply to the more modern Loire Sauvignon Blancs or Sancerres of the world \u2013 with a classic fruit-restrained nose, a much more expressive palate, and a seamlessly balanced acidity on the palate. A bit linear, though. Less complex wines can often be hard to justify at high price points, especially for the shy and elegant whites of the Loire.

Delicate and subtle yet strong, like carbon-fibre. Oyster wine, raw or cooked and drenched with butter, tested and true. As tough as it is to describe: the minerality and acidity in the wine play with the brine and delicate body of the oyster, creating a lasting, refreshing, and satisfying combination. That being said, Sauvignon Blanc isn\u2019t usually a grape I find too exciting. The first few sniffs and sips are awesome, but rarely has a bottle kept me sweaty and hot throughout. New World counterparts are a bit more exciting and flamboyant, but you buy Loire Sauvignon Blanc because you want Loire Sauvignon Blanc.

After a long dry spell of wine stemming from a promised exam study session complete with delayed gratification, I decided to whip this guy off of my rack because New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is what you need when you have a white with an intense aroma profile. The nose was subdued at first but became more intense; what confused me was that it didn\u2019t become more intense in its stereotypical NZ character. Floral and mineral were what I received off the nose, and any citrus was subdued and vague enough to not be specific. For me, at least. Intriguing, however, were the sauteed onion and honeyed spice notes I got off of a 12-dollar 2007 Chilean Sauv Blanc, except in a lighter secondary style. I don\u2019t know what elderflower smells like so perhaps that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting.

I\u2019ve had cheaper white Bordeaux that\u2019s had more New World character than this. I\u2019m usually a fan of atypicality, but this was slightly disappointing. Further blind tasting with my co-workers a day after confirmed my thoughts. They all thought it was an Old World wine. There was hubbub about chalkiness and even a final guess of Chablis or Chardonnay, followed by a discussion on possible malolactic fermentation. They were super surprised by the reveal, and the ones who\u2019ve tasted this wine before or the same wine in a different vintage were sure that it tasted different. It was agreed that this had lower acidity than expected (I KNEW IT), which is weird for such a recent vintage. Bottle variation? Weird vintage? Improper storage? Did someone at the winery leave the bottle out in the sun for revenge? Was the bottle lying right next to the hottest part of the airplane? Did a hen think this was an egg? Oh, the stories!

Coteaux du Giennois is down there with Quincy, Reuilly, and Menetou-Salon as the forgotten hard-to-pronounce children of the Central Vineyards in the Loire, overshadowed by the better-known and much more fashionable Sancerre and Pouilly-Fum\u00e9.

It\u2019s light and slightly unbalanced. It\u2019s refreshing and fun, and I\u2019ll give it that much, but I feel that if you\u2019re going to dull the aromatic characteristics of Sauv Blanc, you might as well amp up something else. Perhaps that\u2019s what the oak was supposed to do, but it just feels tight, shy, and repressed. The wine has the taut acidity\u00a0of a violin wire but comes off as untuned.

That being said, what\u2019s in the market for whites can roughly be split into two camps: there are the more honeyed and oaked white Bordeaux where Sauvignon Blanc lays integrated within the tropical butterscotch, and then there are the modern blends dominated with Sauvignon Blanc which seem like responses to the popular gaudy styles from the new world.

I\u2019m going to see if work will let me wear bloody things and carry around a bloody prop-hammer-axe-not-really-a-prop.

Geez \u2013 it\u2019s such a seemingly pretentious and obscure talent, but being able to identify a wine by smell and taste is so cool. It\u2019s also something I love about wine \u2013 the fact that it\u2019s a liquid expression of where it\u2019s from; a drinkable gustatory and olfactory stamp of an area, whether that be climate, grape, terroir, or particular winemaking. It\u2019s like taking a picture with a camera that records aromas and flavours. This wine in particular was quite Old World in style. Minerality was quite evident on the nose, and funnily enough, I first noticed a nuance of stone fruit. I let the wine warm up a bit to release some aromas, which were more citrus and grassy \u2013 but not pungent in that New World style. I really did enjoy the nose more than the palate. The palate was an explosion of tart lemons and mineral, and the acidity was med to med+ at most, the length was average if not below, and the alcohol was a little bit hot and disjointed which was weird considering the alcohol content (12% ABV). The mineral characteristics screamed Old World, the supposed hot alcohol brought me to the south, and the Sauvignon characteristics brought me to something of a white Bordeaux (Gascogne \u2013 close enough), \u00a0but I recall having a fleeting thought of Albari\u00f1o or Macabeo before I put it in my mouth. Quite young so the vintage was a no-brainer (2010), and I guessed a wine around 20 dollars. Needless to say, I beamed when I guessed the wine correctly. It\u2019s slightly easier because we\u2019re all familiar with the wines in the store. Gros Manseng is a bit obscure though. Can\u2019t say I or many of my colleagues or wine geek friends have ever had any if not one, ever. The citrus in this wine pops so much that it\u2019s almost a replacement for squeezing lemon over your food (or matching it with food that has lemon). I can\u2019t help but think that this would go well with seafood, or in particular, a Filipino dish called \u201cpancit\u201d \u2013 it would be a cool calamansi/lemon replacement, and this wine gave me that tart kick (I\u2019m probably just excited because pairing Filipino food with wine is so tough \u2013 stay tuned for an article).

And I do say wrongly-hated, because it\u2019s such a versatile grape: from the steely versions in Chablis to the big and oaked cowboy bottles in California, it\u2019s such a shame that consumers wave it off. I remember helping out a customer who was looking for a Chablis \u2013 unfortunately, the ones we had were out of her price range, but upon helping her choose a leaner, cooler climate Chardonnay, the cringing \u201cI hate Chardonnay\u201d was uttered. Girl, don\u2019t even. Although easy to grow, Chardonnay buds early, which means that this is probably why the Germans don\u2019t focus on a regional expression, and yet another reason why Champagne is pricey. Chardonnay isn\u2019t entirely disease-resistant either, and can be susceptible to powdery mildew, grapevine yellows, coulure, millerandage, and rot. A long list, but the amount of Chardonnay grown speaks for itself. This was a very good representation of Chardonnay \u2013 typical ripe green fruit notes dominated by the savoury butter, spice, and kernel flavours, with a heavier body, modest acid, and oak on the palate. Buttery smoothness despite the higher-than-expected acid, which is nice. I immediately guessed a Chardonnay from perhaps a cooler pocket of California, but apparently that would be too hot for this example. Even the M\u00e2con in Burgundy was dismissed as being slightly too warm for this example. After some narrowing of our choices, we eventually ended up in New Zealand \u2013 and here we are. I don\u2019t ever recall trying many Chardonnays of the New Zealand variety, but it\u2019s interesting how middling they can be \u2013 reminiscent both of the buttery kernel characteristics that you get in hotter climates, but still retaining a good amount of acidity.

But it\u2019s great and I\u2019m enjoying it, since it\u2019s a nice refreshing change from the sun, and all I wanted to do after work on a Sunday was go home, open wine, and take my pants off.\u00a0It\u2019s one of those days. One of those \u201cmy tea\u2019s gone cold I\u2019m wondering why I got out of bed at all\u201d days. Hence the choice of a hedonistic heavier Chardonnay, chosen to emulate\u00a0a liquid blanket. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a warm milk and malolactic fermentation joke in there somewhere.

It\u2019s not a Californian butteriness either \u2013 it\u2019s not a blousy sweatpants sort of style and the wine drinks like a pair of trousers with a belt for structure. There\u2019s some mineral notes on the nose, and I\u2019m sure I would place this in a riper area of Burgundy if it\u00a0wasn\u2019t for this weird freshness I\u2019m getting from this wine, which I\u2019m attributing to screwcap. There\u2019s a mere hint of spritz which I\u2019m hoping is natural and not from secondary fermentation (and can\u2019t be, anyways (?), since the wine apparently has gone through 100 percent secondary malolactic fermentation). In any case, I\u2019ve had a chat with a colleague that said that wines aged under screwcap will always have this HD freshness compared to an equivalent wine aged under cork. Along with the brightness, the wine has a drawn-out savouriness on the palate which lasts deliciously long.

So really, this is the first dry French Sauv-Sem blend I\u2019ve ever had. Well, I did remember almost trying one in WSET Advanced class, but it was oxidizzled. Every other Sauv-Sem blend I\u2019ve had was from somewhere vastly different \u2013 say Chile, or Australia. The nose was really interesting. I did get these subtle nuances of ripe fruit, which is probably where I got that candied (but not sloppy-candied, i.e. not confected) character from, with an interesting herbal note that was not unlike the green section of the produce market \u2013 fresh, but subtle and elegant. Which I can only guess was from the Sauvignon Blanc. This is a wine that\u2019s more marketed towards the wine-savvy and the Bordeaux collectors.

And here I am reviewing wine, because number 1: I am crazy, and number 2: I miss wine. I miss wine. I won\u2019t in a couple months, where I\u2019ll probably be missing spirits. The Stump Jump is d\u2019Arenberg\u2019s entry-level white blend. I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about the red blend equivalent (a Grenache-Shiraz-Mourv\u00e8dre) and I\u2019m a huge fan of their other wines, so I decided to give this one a go. This year\u2019s blend is 72% Riesling, 11% Marsanne, 9% Sauvignon Blanc, and 8% Roussanne. This is drastically different from the previous year\u2019s (2010) vintage, which was 28% Riesling, 27% Sauvignon Blanc, 25% Marsanne, and 20% Roussanne. According to a previous label, it looks like the grapes from the previous vintage also included grapes from Adelaide Hills along with McLaren Vale; this vintage solely has grapes from the latter. I find this interesting \u2013 perhaps the Stump Jump is made for a rather good quality blend without trying to be consistent in terms of their flavour profile. Perhaps the non-Riesling grapes didn\u2019t survive, or perhaps they\u2019re trying something different. Maybe they knew I would obsess and did it on purpose to laugh at me. Who knows! The wine definitely speaks to its Riesling-dominance in its dry Australian form. Direct citrus notes support subtle pithy peach notes, and a bit of floral character and a balanced minerality add some complexity. Before knowing the blend proportions, I swear I had caught just a touch of a greenness from Sauvignon Blanc \u2013 but maybe that\u2019s just the power of suggestion. The wine is not overtly complex, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what wine aims to be. The subtle complexity that is there, though, reminds me of a ray of sunshine on a cold autumn morning \u2013 not super loud or intense, but subtle and sort of pretty.

Hmm?) to something a little more plain and bold in a weird way. There\u2019s something about the bottles that tell me what they\u2019re like on the front side \u2013 that turn me off, but it\u2019s not a bad marketing technique for the lower-priced bottles. Also, they misspelled \u201cfloral\u201d and it says \u201cflorat\u201d. Mmm, Florat tones! I\u2019ve never had a Malvasia outside of Madeira. From what I know, it\u2019s low in acidity and has floral and stone fruit aromas in its still form, so it understandably blends well with Moscato. This wine gains points for typicity: I smell canned stone fruits with a bit of a tropical kick and some flowers, but two colleagues agreed that the wine was drier \u2013 and even less fruity \u2013 than we expected. The palate definitely lacks more than a bit of depth. The wine seems almost watery, and the lower acid of both grapes is evident, making it a \u201csmooth\u201d wine, so I guess the label wasn\u2019t entirely lying. The disjointed aromatic, watery, and low acid leads me to think that this wine is made for sipping. It should also be served as cold as possible to at least give an illusion of some zippiness. Or add ice and a lemon! Seriously. This isn\u2019t a terrible wine. It doesn\u2019t shout bargain, but it certainly whispers it.

Savenni\u00e8res is\u00a0an\u00a0appellation\u00a0from the Loire Valley in France that produces dry, concentrated, and fundamentally non-fruity wines from Chenin Blanc, and Baumard makes exceptional and superlative examples described by Jancis Robinson as \u201ca wine for intellectuals, not neophytes.\u201d That\u2019s the most shade I\u2019ve ever seen anyone\u00a0throw from within an encyclopedia. It\u2019s one of those wines that\u2019s hard to put into words: so much, that it almost sounds disgusting on paper, but experiencing the wine \u2013 without sounding too ridiculous about it \u2013 really is sort of otherworldly. Not in a superficial\u00a0spiritual sense, but in a way where you\u2019re questioning how the fuck a wine could smell and taste like cream of mushroom soup. I\u00a0understand the wasabi note\u00a0that manifests itself\u00a0from\u00a0the mineral, wet wool, and savoury notes you typically get from dry Loire Chenin Blanc. It\u2019s just much more concentrated here, with fruit playing second or even third fiddle, the nose posing much more wet wool in its place, and to a lesser extent, cream of mushroom and slightly oxidative scents. It\u2019s a wine that\u2019s apparently\u00a0undrinkable in its youth and takes years and years for it to even blossom, and I believe it, but I wonder how much faith and time it took to figure out the secrets of\u00a0dry aged Chenin. It\u2019s like the Feebas-Milotic of wine, and if you understood that, that\u2019s all you really need to know. The palate is full-bodied, but the wine isn\u2019t as high in acid as I expected for a Savenni\u00e8res that\u2019s relatively early in its journey. The alcohol is a bit evident on the finish, but can be forgiven with the lush and developing flavours of cream, mushroom, and mineral on the palate. The wine\u2019s center is quite\u00a0savoury and it ends slightly bitter and floral, but they intertwine with the hints of mushroom and mineral flavours\u00a0well onto a long finish.\u00a0During some research, I now understand the common tasting note of there being some lack of uplift. Andrew Jefford describes this particular wine\u00a0as one that \u201c[rivals] Corton-Charlemagne and Montrachet; dense, glycerous and flavor saturated packed with honey nuts and flowers.\u201d I can\u2019t say whether or not this is an exaggeration because I haven\u2019t had my fair shares of Corton-Charlemagne or Montrachet (you can\u2019t spell Montrachet without ratchet! *slow clap*), but I can say with certainty that this is pretty damn good for half or a third of the price of the purported Burgundian counterparts. Liquid mushrooms, wet wool, wasabi, and stones never tasted so delicious.

I was really on the fence on spending that much on a wine (school is expensive!), but through several points including celebration, treating myself because of my new certification, and Thanksgiving itself, I decided to go for it. And so I slowly nursed a bottle of 2007 Domaine des Baumard Trie Sp\u00e9ciale\u00a0to myself on (Canadian) Thanksgiving. I\u2019m sure no one else around me would have enjoyed a bottle that tasted like cream of mushroom and delicious wet winter sweaters. Savenni\u00e8res is a small appellation in the northern part of Anjou, where dry and concentrated wines from Chenin Blanc are made. Other appellations like Quarts de Chaume, Coteaux du Layon, and Bonnezeaux in the southern parts of Anjou typically make sweeter versions, so Savenni\u00e8res is almost like the weird dry anomaly. It used ti be sweeter in the past, and legally, I still think it can, but why do that, when you can make something weird, dry, and full-bodied, like me? Here we revisit another one of Baumard\u2019s wines \u2013 one which I\u2019ve had several times within the past few years. Perhaps I was just in a theatrical mood but my eyes did roll to the back of my head when I tasted it. It\u2019s lusciously strange \u2013 much like the 2007 Trie Sp\u00e9ciale, it has a full mushroomy body with lots of mineral, wet wool, and hints of fruit. A classmate asked the instructor whether or not this could age, and she\u00a0passionately responded \u201cof course!\u201d, and how the wine is currently only starting to show hints of development. The wine is apparently unappetizing at an age less than 7 years, but I suppose this truism can be\u00a0bypassed for such a great years like 2009.

I\u2019m not entirely sure why \u2013 perhaps because it\u2019s versatile, but in such a different way than Riesling or Chardonnay. Riesling noticeably varies most in its sugar; Chardonnay with its weight and flavours. It\u2019s interesting how Chenin can be an unpredictable fellow, producing sparkling wine with unripe grapes for example, sweet wines with slightly riper grapes, and then dry wines with even riper grapes. Or something like that. Even grapes affected with noble rot are quite common, as are late harvest versions. I find Chenin Blanc exciting, but of course there are a lot of uninteresting examples out there. And, like Semillon, there are many premium producers (in the Loire) that make Chenin Blanc worthy for ageing, with a honeyed wet wool and nutty baked apple sort of way \u2013 but are indeed boring in youth, which is a shame. By deduction and being the last wine, we knew we were tasting Chenin Blanc, but the oak and buttery characteristics, not unlike some Chardonnay, brought us straight to South Africa, where oak is more common for Chenin Blanc. It is similar to some Chardonnay, with softer apple tones and a interesting funky earthy woolly character. This wine was very good quality for 25 bones.

The first time around we were given 5 white wines to match with 5 different grape varieties so Chenin Blanc was basically a given, but this time around it was a little tougher. I mean, you smell heavy oak and baked apple on the nose with that identical echo on the palate, and you immediately think new world oaked Chardonnay. You just do. Even if you\u2019re a super advanced taster and you knew it wasn\u2019t new world oaked Chardonnay, the thought has to have at least crossed your mind. It\u2019s like you see that one haughty\u00a0scarf-wearing\u00a0guy\u00a0in the lineup one October when you\u2019re in the line for Starbucks, and it\u2019s like \u201cthis bitch is definitely going to order a Pumpkin Spice Latte and I bet he has\u00a0an unforgivingly difficult hipster name for the barista to write on the cup\u201d. And even if he orders a grande dark roast\u00a0and his name is Tom, you\u2019re like \u201cI bet this bitch enjoys them\u00a0anyways\u201d. The South African style of Chenin Blanc tends towards the riper and powerful driven examples opposed to the tight Loire versions that can take years to open up. There\u2019s almost a parallel with new world oaked Chardonnays and tight white Burgundy. And so I and whoever read their notes out for this definitely thought this was Chardonnay, but the key factor is the acid, something which Chenin Blanc is naturally high in. It\u2019s a nice alternative to a Chardonnay that might be better for a versatile food pairing (Thanksgiving, hint hint), and you still get that meaty texture for a white and that baked apple character, but with a frame of acid that keeps it fresh. Speaking of Pumpkin Spice Lattes and Thanksgiving \u2013 this is a superb\u00a0autumn wine which combines the weightier warmth in a cooler season and some cozy baking spice. It\u2019s no wonder why Pumpkin Spice Lattes are such a huge thing at this time of year, and I suppose\u00a0it\u2019ll take South African Chenin Blanc years before it equates to such a thing, and I hope that it eventually does.    \u00a0", "harvested_from": "http://www.joshlikeswine.com/2014/10/07/2013-bellingham-the-bernard-series-vieilles-vignes-chenin-blanc/", "count": 1, "mouth": "N/A", "eyes": "clear, med lemon, legs", "abv": "\u00a014%", "nose": "clean, developing, med+ intensity, butter, oak, nectarine, cream, sweet spice, vanilla, baked apple", "region": "South Africa", "price": "\u00a025", "variety": "Chenin Blanc", "vintage": "\u00a02013", "sub_region": "WO Coastal Region", "producer": "Bellingham"}, {"name": "2005 Champalou Vouvray Le Clos du Portail", "overall": "\u00a0Interesting, teasing, worth a try, very good quality; can drink now, but has potential for ageing.", "description": "  I\u2019m starting this new game at work where I ask whoever I\u2019m closing with to pick a random bottle from the store given a reasonable price range, have them charge it to my card (I trust them THAT much, I know) so that we can both taste it while I can try it blind and perhaps attempt to guess the varietal given I\u2019m not too embarrassed to do so.

What struck me next was the interesting nose \u2013 overripe apples (or what my colleague called \u201cbruised\u201d) were what I noticed first, with this super intriguing undertone of oxidized nuttiness that was almost sherry-like in character. We also detected a touch of honey, and my colleague also noticed some notes of fennel except I have no idea what fennel smells like so I just nodded. The ripe nose instantly made me think of a Sp\u00e4tlese, and the honey almost made me think of something late harvest-y that I had before (a colleague from another job even compared it to a Tokaji), but the palate made me think otherwise. Pretty much everything about the mouthfeel threw me off my initial suspicions. I did guess (correctly) the Old World at first, and then Germany (which was wrong). She hinted to me that the wine was from France. Then, she said that I was right having guessed that it was from the Loire. I then correctly guessed that it was Vouvray, and subsequently I rejoiced.

I\u2019ve only ever had few Vouvray wines in the past, all of ranging qualities, but I\u2019ve noticed that all of them having this sort of \u201cteasing\u201d quality, whether it be from the nose or the sweetness \u2013 and not that sort of \u201cbad teasing\u201d quality either, where sometimes you feel a wine straddles the line between several identities and doesn\u2019t fully commit to a character \u2013 but instead, makes this intrigue an identity in itself (or maybe I\u2019m just bullshitting). That being said: if this wine were a person, it would be Cersei Lannister. Oh God, yes. It\u2019s perfect. I guessed a 30 dollar wine, but it\u2019s really 42. It\u2019s a strange and intriguing wine worth trying if you have the bones, but I\u2019m sure there are other sort-of-just-as-complex Vouvray wines that don\u2019t break the bank. I think.

Hurrah! I wanted to open something nice for my co-workers and I as an excuse. I bounced around between several bottles before settling on this dude. And then I realized how poor I am. Yay! The cork was horrifying. Upon lifting the foil at the top, we discovered that the cork almost had something like a mini-pool of wine at the top and was damp all throughout. With some effort we removed the cork properly without a hitch, and the golden liquid was free for us to taste. As expected, the nose is interesting and complex. Any fruit exists only as a ghost of citrus dominated by secondary and tertiary characteristics. Honey, wax, and butterscotch are all evident. There are also some weird aromas \u2013 weird in the sense that the aromas might be bizarre or even repulsive to the newcomer (like petrol notes in aged Riesling) but interesting to the wine nerd nonetheless. And by that, I mean we smelled cabbage and garbage water, but like, in a good way. There was also a flutter of a wet asphalt minerality \u2013 almost like fresh rain on a road. Ironic aromas reminiscent of fresh images, considering the age on this. Less graceful on the palate \u2013 the acidity was impressive, but almost unwoven, as per with the alcohol which seemed to slightly warm the back despite lower alcohol. Definitely powerful, concentrated, and round, with a bright citrus character dominating the palate. Slight sherry-like oxidative quality on the finish. Long length. What\u2019s interesting is that they apparently experimented with this wine by ageing it in French oak for 18 months. This is definitely a nerd wine \u2013 I can see the regular consumer being interested in trying this, but be easily repulsed at the same time. This wine is also quite concentrated and powerful \u2013 not for the faint-hearted. If I had this by itself, I\u2019d only be able to have one glass. Perhaps this calls for food, and my colleagues and I agreed that some sort of fatty smoked fish would work. Could this age? The developed characteristics tell me that even if it could, changes would be minute, and could very well veer into the depths of full oxidation. Though, the acidity and structure is definitely there, and Chateau Musar is known for creating long-lived wines, so it very well might be possible.

Also: the one night I really should have been an Instagram junky, because there were some fantastic (and surprisingly subpar) wines that were had that night, though I guess I was too focussed on unexpectedly breaking wine glasses and attempting to be a socially acceptable human being. oh no UGH THOUGH I felt like an incomplete being the next morning, as if\u00a0a large chunk\u00a0of my sobriety was smeared on the road outside. And my first thought was not \u201cis my wallet still in my jacket?!\u201d, but was more along the lines of \u201care my Bordeaux notes still in my jacket pocket and are they dry?!\u201d and the headrush as I got up from the couch to check was not a good one, but all was good in the world, almost fantastic\u00a0enough to make me sing praises to god and then make an irritating Tumblr picture out of it. And then I went out for Dim Sum with family because it was Family Day. Cinq \u00e0 Sept on Tuesday at the Abbey. It was great, considering that the last one involved forever Gin and amaro. This time it was tame but with the busyness and crowded qualities of a swimming pool\u2019s locker room during a hot summer day. Sometimes, \u201cnetworking\u201d is a word I hate a little more than \u201cmoist\u201d. So thanks, alcohol. Why hasn\u2019t Sia written a song about my life yet? After, a friend and I escaped to drink more wine and eat dinner at Merchants. And we stole another friend to join us over Nahe Riesling and weird manure-esque Salice Salentino. And sour beer things. That\u2019s all I mostly remember, and that\u2019s definitely not a good sign? Not pictured: sobriety Bottle share the next day. This included Sauternes (thus enabling the use of a stupid \u201cYou Sauternes me on\u201d joke) and a vertical of Driftwood\u2019s Cellar Dweller among other cool things. Untappd booster pack, basically. And my beer cellar grows faster than I consume its contents, so\u00a0any excuse to bring beer to a thing is a good one?  Taylor on Thursday. And so what happened was accidental 90s night. I *just* missed the whole pogs thing while growing up, being part of the tail-end of the 90s kids generation, but I\u2019m surprisingly decent at a game that requires aim even in the slightest because I\u2019m literally the opposite of Katniss.

Also not in the cards: me being an architect. In the cards: me drinking cheap wine and still enjoying it.

It was reminiscent to the first wine in our flight of three, in that there was a real evolved pomaceous fruit character, with bruised red apple and dried pear that met\u00a0with dried peaches, some apricots, honey, spice, mushroom, and apple jam. This might sound identical to\u00a0so many other kinds of aged sweet wine, say an aged sweet Chenin from the Loire Valley, but there\u2019s a huge emphasis on the bruised apple flavour, and interestingly enough, a lack of that oxidative nutty character you might find. A darker colour, too. Perhaps it\u2019s because this wine still remains really fresh, especially on the palate, where acid is high but well-hidden like a stoner on Commercial Drive, and you can almost pick out the\u00a0interaction between the brightness and the succulent apple fruit on the palate.

The 51 grand cru vineyards vary in size, the larger ones perhaps not being consistent with grape quality depending on the size and varying soils of the vineyard. Some producers jump on the grand cru vineyard bandwagon for easy cash, and some producers even omit the fact that they use fruit from grand cru vineyards because they choose not to promote the questionable status. Anyways, I really liked this wine. There was a lot of evolved fruit in this Riesling: along with bits of petrol, there were\u00a0tons of ripe green and baked fruit, some ripe stone fruit, a bit of spice, and honey. Potpourri, even. The wine was so weirdly reminiscent of autumn to me, almost evoking some sort of Windows XP desktop background. Autumnal spice like wafting leaves, and high acids like\u00a0brisk winds.

I\u2019ve been home all day studying (and recovering from last night, for that matter) just to give myself an excuse to open something fantastic given I work through this fat stack of Champagne flash cards (which I did). So here we are, and I really wish I had a third arm that could possibly aid me in sipping some of this wine as I type with two of my normal human hands. Sex must be weirdly fantastic with a person that has three arms, but I guess it would depend where that hand exuded from the body. Are these the thoughts that flow through my mind with Auslese? Because I\u2019m pretty sure picking out wedding colours comes with drinking white Rioja. Anyways, I decided upon this bottle realizing how odd of a value it was \u2013 $38 for an Auslese older than 15 years is a steal. Two years ago, we had tried the 1995 Zilliken Riesling Auslese Saarburger Rausch in class, which was deemed a good deal at $59. Though that particular wine was in a slightly different style being from the Mosel, it really puts into perspective how fantastic this bottle is at 38 bones, and it makes you wonder what the fuck is wrong with it if at all anything. But it seems stupendous so far, and maybe I\u2019m just extra excited that I\u2019m no longer fruitlessly attempting to remember the dates at which some Champagne houses were established. Oy.

It\u2019s interesting but less so than other Auslesen I\u2019ve had in the past, not to say that this was terrible. The price is still a steal.

I sheepishly display my confusion and partial\u00a0sophomoric knowledge on German wines here, in part because a lot of the German wines I come across are too expensive for me. I\u2019ve also noticed that Riesling has been in a bit of a negative light to the regular consumer, and it\u2019s all about the dry. Riesling is as out as much as Coco Rocha is in, and despite its food pairing versatility, people avoid it like the plague because they think it\u2019ll be like juice. The university crowd likes this \u2013 I introduced Riesling to a group of university students and they went forth and spread their knowledge to their fellow brobots. Back on topic \u2013 the vintage. Among other 2011 German Riesling vintages (most notably the 2011 Selbach Riesling and the 2011 Rudolf Muller Riesling), I\u2019ve noticed that these wines lack the aromaticity that I expect from Riesling. Perhaps I don\u2019t drink enough Old World Riesling to truly understand the character in its European homeland. Here, we have a wine with a strength that lies in its elegance. Delicate aromas are vague at first, but reveal themselves as sweet (but not canned) yet restrained fruity characteristics with a flowery nose. A restrained minerality blankets the whole. But I\u2019m really just trying to be poetic, here. It smells like high class fruity sugar water with some pebbles mixed in. The palate is light and has a brush of medium sweetness that jumps away by a rather unexpected modest amount of acidity and a solid amount of minerality that shines at the back of the tongue. The acidity is not as high as I expected but is present enough to barely negate the cloy. The length is average, and the little bit of tangy citrus spritz is reminiscent of an applause that doesn\u2019t seem to reach its plateau. Elegant and unassuming, but I almost feel like there\u2019s something missing, besides a slight lack in acidity. Ageing might be an interesting thing to play around with this wine because I feel like there are characteristics that need developing.

The nitty gritty details: the wine once retailed at around the high 20s or low 30s range, disappeared off the market for a bit, and then came back at a mere 18 bones (the agency is perhaps blowing them out? Too old, or?) so I knew I had to snag a few. I bought two, but the first bottle declined to sparkle and I subsequently wondered if I was an asshole for returning the bottle for another one. Probably. I\u2019ve got a streak going and I gotta live up to it, anyways \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be a good person and start all these rumours about it. Ugh. So, a similar thing happened to a friend of mine, who drank the wine anyways \u2013 because it literally is like a sparkling version of Clare Valley Riesling \u2013 floral, citrus, flecks of petrol (perhaps an artificial reference to poison? Hm?!). The palate is like sparkling lemonade sans the sugar along with wine-twists of mineral, floral character, suggestions to tropical fruit, and a soft lemon rind bitterness. It\u2019s spring with a twist. It\u2019s a pretty wine, and I want to gay it up and throw a flower petal into my glass (Loras Tyrell, is that you?). There\u2019s quite a backbone of acidity but it\u2019s well-balanced. This wine has spent 18 months on the lees, i.e. the dead yeast cells from second fermentation. Riesling isn\u2019t a grape that typically undergoes such a process because it\u2019s known for its opulent fruitiness, and any yeast or resulting bread flavours would only mask its natural intense persona. You get a little bit of that yeasty character from this wine, and it sort of works since this is a tighter version of Riesling where we taste restrained citrus instead of riper and sluttier fruit. And we hardly see much sparkling Riesling, anyways. I suppose the bubbles add character where I saw there could\u2019ve been more complexity. Not negative \u2013 more clever.

It\u2019s hard to tell from a grape that\u2019s supposed to be drunk as soon as possible (i.e. within two years of the vintage for dry Alsatian Muscat) but is listed on the producer\u2019s website to be enjoyed from 2012-2022. It\u2019s dry but not oily like Gewurztraminer (a grape that its often compared to and sometimes confused with in blind tastings) and instead has a strong runway of savouriness\u00a0that carries on to the finish. Seems to be an intended style according to the winery\u2019s tasting notes.

I\u2019ve dabbled with a bit of Gros Manseng in the past, but the underdog wines of Southwest France intrigue me. They\u2019re understated hipster twin grapes. Hello, Mary-Kate and Ashley! 2012 went down in history for the setting of catastrophically low (yet not necessarily low quality) yields in Europe, resulting in drastically lower exports in some areas, and lower quality in regions where viticulturists and winemakers played the parts of absent parents. So buying a pricier bottle of wine branded with a scarlet letter was already a risk, but curiosity made the cat drunk. So here we are, and I\u2019m so glad you can\u2019t see all the typos, spilled wine, and teardrops from back-to-back proposal videos and Project Runway. Both grapes in the mix are intrinsically intensely flavoured. But Gros Manseng is the much more vigorous grape of the two (let\u2019s call this one Ashley), while Petit Manseng has smaller berries at lower yields, resulting in slightly intenser flavours of the latter grape (let\u2019s call this one Mary-Kate). Both grapes need care in the winery due to thick skins (hence higher levels of polyphenols and tannins), but both grapes naturally contain a high amount of acid, easily enabling winemakers to let them ripen on the vine. This can lead to better levels of phenolic ripeness and the possible option of late-harvest sweet treats. These grapes are surprisingly easier growers, which means that my stupid Olsen twin analogy isn\u2019t completely nothing. Yay! Full House, y\u2019all. I\u2019m a bit of a basket case when it comes to detecting oak (and TCA for that matter), but this time I\u2019ve guessed correctly (!), with the wine having seen 6 months of fermentation and age in oak. The nose is quite intriguing with a spicy apricot sort of deal, along with a hint of vague melon. The palate shows similar flavours, but the fruit is overtaken by a wave of refreshing minerality, leaving behind a sand bed of savoury spice.\u00a0The wine doesn\u2019t hide its alcohol content very well, but it retains some level of finesse and freshness despite the expected fullness. The palate has acid, but it\u2019s not the mouth-filling tartaric acid: a tart front-filling malic acid character adds a tangy sour candy sort of feel.\u00a0The direct stone fruit character, minerality, and headiness are reminiscent of Alsatian Pinot Gris, but the bit of oak and acidity are different enough to leave a different sort of footprint. Now I\u2019m deciding whether or not I should invest more tears onto online videos or sleep like a normal person. But I think I\u2019ve opened that window after writing about wine at 3AM.

Or does it, because it\u2019s 10PM on a Saturday and all I want to do is be boring and sleep. I\u2019m an exciting 22-year-old. I had tried this exact wine for the first time just two days beforehand, and I remember it being fantastic. So fantastic, that I had to snag a bottle for my own to either revel in the newfound glory of a BC wine I might actually crave for once, and also to confirm and do a double-take just in case that moment might\u2019ve been crazy and ephemeral. So I happened to grab a bottle of this after having drinks with old friends \u2013 and then beers happened \u2013 which was probably not so much of a good idea. I mostly remember drunkenly eating fish tacos, dipping fries in ketchup, and yelling at my best friend and then demanding selfies be taken. Cough. As an attempt to mirror the first time, I opened this closer to room temperature with just a slight chill. Upon viewing, I remember the wine being slightly darker in colour \u2013 though I\u2019m not doubting the fact that the first bottle could have been a bit more oxidized (in a good way). I also remembered that the nose was much more \u2013 to put it crudely \u2013 interesting. Some facets still remain \u2013 there are aromas of juicy grapefruit, an herbal-floral character, and an underlying hint of honey and tangerine \u2013 but something tells me it was much more intense and honey-driven on the nose the first time around. Perhaps it was just outstanding compared to the other wines in the lineup. Or maybe I\u2019m just horrendously tired? Who knows. The palate matches up much more correctly in my memory \u2013 there is a surprisingly intense opening of ripe and almost candied citrus and grapefruit, with juicy acidity and citrus rind flavours falling into a savoury and long dry finish. Impressively, there is a considerable amount of body which makes me marvel at the moderate 12.8% ABV, but this oddity is weirdly double-edged, and the back-palate ends up being quite boozy. That one friend you think doesn\u2019t drink but ends up being the one doing the most shots during that one spring break? This wine. Also this wine: the knight of flowers, because floral and citrus characteristics aren\u2019t often coupled (or thought to be coupled) with unctuousness or brawn. And also because I\u2019m still hung up on the fact that there won\u2019t be any Game of Thrones for a good year or so. The odes to the white Bordeaux blends are almost overdone yet robust versions are often underrated. I often crave the summery Sauvignon Blanc characteristics with the forbearing qualities of a peaty scotch or buttery Chardonnay by the fireplace (in this case \u2013 Semillon), and sometimes the heavier versions of white Bordeaux do just that. Like today was actually fine, but my emotions started to falter in the middle of it for no valid reason like a random bug in the code.

Hmm. I can see it. Sauvignon Blanc + Semillon makes for an interesting blend in their dry forms. It makes sense that the honeyed, tropical, and flabby-when-ripe botrytized grape is freshened up by the fresh-flavoured grape, but in their still forms, it\u2019s almost exactly what you\u2019d expect: a girthed-up Sauvignon Blanc with more body and less intensity, replaced by the neutralizing honeyed and soft citrus of Semillon. To me, the first blends that come to mind exist in Bordeaux, Australia, and Chile \u2013 although I\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing many more regions. In Bordeaux, it\u2019s a little more elegant \u2013 more structure, with fresh herb-like Sauvignon character; in Australia, fruity, young, and soft; and in Chile, a more stewed and heavier character, with the herb-y Bordeaux expressed as the greenness more reminiscent of green bell peppers further softened by the Semillon. And that\u2019s exactly what this was \u2013 and easy-drinking, soft expression which probably has the least amount of obvious green Sauvignon character than you\u2019d expect of the regions I\u2019ve mentioned (at least to my experience, so far). The guess of white Bordeaux was nothing more than a shot in the dark, perhaps as a shadow to the stunning White Bordeaux we tried a couple weeks ago that no one was sure what to think about, myself included. Ah, well. I\u2019ve never liked the shape of these bottles, but the wine was better than I would have expected. Although simple, the balanced acid is a redeeming quality to the also slightly imbalanced alcohol, but the flavours are soft and elegant, and this isn\u2019t bad for 17 dollars at all.

Classico", "overall": "Good quality; drink now.", "description": "  I\u2019ve read about the definition and forgot about a million times, but the term \u201cclassico\u201d refers to the original area in which these wines and grapes originated from. For example, since its inception, places like Chianti have extended to include regions like Chanti Rufina, which generally use the same grapes with different elements of terroir. \u201cClassico\u201d refers to those original areas in Italy. Although Italian whites are known for their neutrality, they can often have a certain subtle nuttiness to them as well. I find that to be common is most Soave, and at times it reaches this marzipan-like aroma. Compared to the Arneis we had against this, this was noticeably muskier, although still rather neutral. Rather medium in everything, and I\u2019m wishing it could\u2019ve been more complex. Also: damn. Because I\u2019ve been pronouncing the grape incorrectly, like \u00a0forever.

Oz Clarke waxes poetic about how hot and bothered he gets by (good) Viognier, and so I hopped on that train and thought this was Viognier. A nose from what I thought was more citrus and stone fruit dominated was more green fruit-centric in the experienced mind of the instructor (although there was a agreed-upon and marked nectarine character), but I was correct in detecting a yoghurt-y baked custard sort of characteristic both on the nose and palate, stemming from the good ol\u2019 malolactic fermentation. I\u2019m guessing that this is what Oz might be referring to with the whole cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche thing.\u00a0(Condrieu is still on the spit bucket list.) That, and this isn\u2019t exactly what I think of when I think of Pinot Blanc. I finally understand the whole comparison to Chardonnay, but most Pinot Blancs I\u2019ve had have been simple, fruity, lighter in body, and have never reached this complexity. Combined with the fact that \u201cPinot Blanc\u201d from Alsace may actually be a blend of that and Auxerrois (and in some cases may be all Auxerrois and no Pinot Blanc at all, much like Trebbiano d\u2019Abruzzo), and you have a sad and ignored little grape that gets beat up by all the other macho grapes after school. The colour and ripeness makes sense to me, here, because Alsace (and I assume southwest Germany by extension, assuming no strong geographical difference) is generally a dry and sunny area. Sunny areas in southern Germany can lead to riper \u00a0and fuller-bodied styles of the variety. I recall week 2 \u2013 my embarrassing guess of Alsace Riesling as some oddly bright Chardonnay. This was a fantastic and unique wine. Don\u2019t go chasing it down anytime soon, because the heartbreaking fact is that German Pinot Blancs are rare in this market (maybe one in the BCL), and the shape of the Bocksbeutel inconveniences both restaurants and storage units. That didn\u2019t stop Mateus, but this isn\u2019t Mateus. This is a unique wine with a label that\u2019s difficult to read despite its simplicity, and sadly enough, with the slow progression of wine culture in BC, we probably won\u2019t be seeing wines of this specific nature any time soon.

The wine comes from the leftmost stretch\u00a0of the Loire Valley in France, created by a neutral and fresh grape which can gain complexity from chilling on dead yeast cells, resulting in more texture and flavour. Its wines can often be bland and light\u00a0on the nose with an old world monochrome template of mineral, green fruit, and hints of yeast. But the best examples, like in this wine, are much more expressive on the palate, with the yeasty, savoury, and bready components staging a complex dance on the tongue.\u00a0You can tell that there\u2019s much more texture\u00a0which comes out in the viscosity and creaminess. Muscadet is literally like boring white bread. Do you remember the last time you\u2019ve had really exciting white bread? Rarely do I come across white bread wines that veer into the very good category, but there\u2019s an interesting yeasty complexity on the palate. That being said, one of my classmates deemed this as only acceptable quality, and in that moment, I made the douchiest turn and eyebrow raise, so perhaps this style of wine is not for everyone. Or I\u2019m just a douche. One of my wine friends made the interesting analogy that Muscadet is like bubble-less Champagne: at the centre of the Venn diagram, they both have green fruit flavours, some citrus, high acid, and yeasty complexity; both pair classically with oysters. Though, they markedly have different textures, price points, and reputations \u2013 especially after really bad frosts cut production in 1991.    \u00a0", "harvested_from": "http://www.joshlikeswine.com/2014/10/21/2010-chateau-de-la-gravelle-gorges-muscadet-sevre-et-maine-sur-lie/", "count": 1, "mouth": "dry, med+ body, high acid, med- alcohol, med+ length, med+ flavour intensity, yeast, green fruit, green apple, citrus", "eyes": "clear, pale lemon, legs", "abv": "\u00a012.5%", "nose": "clean, med- intensity, developing, yeasty, mineral, green fruit, green apple, bread, hint funkiness", "region": "France", "price": "\u00a022", "variety": "Melon de Bourgogne", "vintage": "\u00a02010", "sub_region": "Muscadet S\u00e8vre et Maine AOC, Loire Valley", "producer": "Ch\u00e2teau de la Gravelle"}, {"name": "2011 Barton & Guestier The Pairing Collection \u201cLobster and Shrimp\u201d Muscadet S\u00e8vre-et-Maine", "overall": "Good quality: light without being dilute with good med+ acid structure despite elegance.

It\u2019s one of those wines that I feel is made for food, and its character with its lonesome \u2013 both in theory and in practice \u2013 comes off as boring to me, even though I wouldn\u2019t deny a glass of this. Such a wine pairing comes alive with certain seafood (apparently\u2026 I\u2019ve never actually tried this), but I can see a good quality fifteen-dollar wine going with a sunny day as well. Anything, really. Who are we kidding? This wine was chosen to display the fact that even AOC wines can by a bit campy and marketing-driven with their labels, especially in a region, like France, where AOC wines can be considered more traditional and subtle; that is, people don\u2019t need the marketing, because people will automatically come to them with what people see as the regional gold standard for wines (which is an idea that is changing for this scene). And why not? The label isn\u2019t vomit-inducing by any means, unless you have a fear of lobsters. Otherwise, the packaging is neat, eye-catching, and suggestive. I would deem this some form of a marketing success, and the wine wasn\u2019t bad either. The was an example of a good quality wine, and strictly a good quality wine; not \u201cacceptable\u201d, and not \u201cvery good\u201d. Simple, but had plenty of freshness and structure, and although lacking further complexity, it still spoke to a place. The mineral tones were evident and balanced on this guy, unlike an overwhelming stony savoury character that takes over the palate in other mineral-driven wines. The Loire guess wasn\u2019t too hard, but Muscadet was my second guess. I sometimes find that Loire Chenin can be light and snobby in youth, hence the guess.

But it is tough \u2013 the pronounced stone fruit, tropical fruit, and spice flavours often allude to a small set of grapes with similar profiles \u2013 even the bit of Froot Loops-y cardamom I got on the nose was reminiscent of Viognier, but it turned out to be Muscat. It was the next wine that was Gewurztraminer, which in turn, I had guessed was Muscat. Apparently this is a unique style of Muscat, since drier, more full styles are less common \u2013 so a guess of Gew was \u201cmore likely\u201d \u2013 although the deeper colour of the next wine should\u2019ve hinted to Gew. Muscat is another grape with a reputation for sweeter wines, and, compared to the Riesling example, it\u2019s much more justified this time because it really is hard to find drier versions \u2013 but they exist. It already seems one note, but interestingly enough, there are sub-varieties of Muscat, all with slightly different profiles. I believe this was made of the Muscat Blanc \u00e0 Petits Grains variety, which is considered the finest sub-variety of Muscat, but I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this was Muscat Ottonel, which is a lower acid, more pungent style of the grape, which finds itself at one of its homes in Alsace. The wine itself was delicious. Lower-acid, overt stone and tropical fruits, but not totally veering into the perfumed floral character that some other grapes do. Not syrupy either, but there is some sort of structure, if barely. The complexity is definitely there. An interesting try for 30 dollars.

Really interesting stuff. Beautiful deep lemon colour, coupled by an interesting nose quite reminiscent of a Vouvray I tried a couple weeks back. Instead, though, the honey and woodier spices were more pronounced, with the fruit taking a bit more of the back seat role in the vehicle that was this wine. Oh man. My analogies.\u00a0Oxidative notes were present and integrated well with the spice notes. So like, the middle seat of the van. Or the front compartment where you keep your licence and registration.  The palate was really interesting, and the sweetness is really hard to peg. The wine begins with this sweetness, but quickly becomes overtaken by this streak of bitterness and slight acidity that takes over the palate and has this two-toned sort of personality. You sort of get that teasing quality, but it\u2019s more of that alluring sweetness that gradually falls into that bitter badass quality. Very Saoirse Ronan from Hanna. lol my analogies. The body is heavy and has that slightly oily mouthfeel, with just enough acidity to have good structure. After tasting this wine, it reminded me more of a couple (very good value) Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc wines I\u2019ve had in the past, which, while sweet, still had that bitterness to back up the sweetness. Although not Chenin Blanc, I did guess an Old World wine.\nGermany? False.\nFrance? Correct.\n(\u201cGermany wasn\u2019t too far off\u2026\u201d)\nAlsace? Correct.

I\u2019m trying to force myself to sip on some of the hard stuff whenever I feel like a drink, but wine is definitely the drink of choice, and I\u2019m most certainly beer\u2019d out for the time being. Craving something a bit riper, my colleagues were surprised when I wanted something as loud as Gew, but I settled on this because I haven\u2019t done the Pinot Gris in a while and I wanted something with a bit of meat on the bones without being, well, Gewurz. The wine suits almost exactly what I was craving. There is a bit of sweetness that sits on the fence between the camps of dry and off-dry, and the wine has a bit of typical oiliness. The juicy stone fruit (with a suggestion of mango) on the palate is pleasantly replaced by a vibrant minerality and just a sparkle of medium acid. There is a bit of bitter pith character on the finish which perhaps stemmed from the extraction of the phenols. Or something like that. There is always something that I find so strange but relaxed and effortless about Alsatian Pinot Gris. It\u2019s not the grassiness of Sauvignon Blanc that exudes to me the archetypal image of a sunny green meadow, but the relaxed texture and structure of Pinot Gris.

And not just for wine \u2013 the idea of a cool climate with constant sun sounds about like my dream weather. Combine that with an area with a beautiful region plus an interesting history, and you have me sold. I\u2019m going to halt my shitty speech of romance here partly because I want to sip more of this wine and partly because I should do some studying before it goes all to my head. But yes \u2013 the climactic uniqueness of Alsace, partly due to the Vosges mountains, results in constant sun, lower rainfall, and a cool climate. Grapes are therefore relatively more reliably ripe here \u2013 and despite the light-bodied reputation of certain grapes, fuller-bodied yet equally-as-bright versions of Riesling can be found here. Along with the minimum treatment of wine and the decision to hold back malolactic fermentation in most Alsatian wines, I would argue that most wine here is about distinct grape character and fruit purity. (What kills me is that Pinot Blanc is often given the shaft and is blended with Auxerrois, still being labelled only by the former, despite great examples that it can make.) I am not a big Pinot Gris/Grigio fan, partly because it usually doesn\u2019t excite me, and partly because the fans who overrate the grape remind me of fans who overrate Justin Bieber. But unlike Justin Bieber, this is an example of a wine whose grapes have had time to mature on the vine, resulting in phenolic ripeness and high levels of sugar, though acid levels are slightly lower as a result. This is Pinot Gris. Pinot Grigio retains more of a lighter-bodied zip by being picked earlier, much to the detriment of the undeveloped flavours. This is a beautiful wine. Stone and citrus fruits dominate the nose, with a noted mineral and musky character. The palate is expressive and ripe, while filling the mid-palate with honey, ripe citrus rind, and stone fruit, then ending with a very long and savoury finish. The acid is not particularly high yet the wine has the impression of being bright and loud \u2013 so despite classic Alsatian weather, this wine isn\u2019t quite a bottle of sunshine.

This was the wine for which I had to read out my tasting notes. I\u2019m getting better at confirming my notes and not being a nervous wreck when reading them out loud \u2013 and much to my surprise, it turns out that my set of notes was good and mostly true to the wine. And so I was happy!\u00a0The only thing I didn\u2019t do was come up with a country that this was from. Not enough girth to be Alsatian, nor crisp and neutral to be the style done up as (or done down as) Pinot Grigio. The ones I\u2019ve had from BC have been more obvious in oak (perhaps this isn\u2019t a generalization), and so I was undecided. And it\u2019s weird, because I don\u2019t remember ever having a Pinot Gris so overt in its stone fruit notes. The wine was softer and lower in its acidity, but didn\u2019t hide behind the forms of oak and insipid neutral character that I\u2019m used to. It\u2019s very interesting how a relatively inexpensive bottle can be so informative. Pinot Gris isn\u2019t as popular as Pinot Grigio, but it\u2019s still pretty popular. The former tends to be fuller bodied, spicy, and more concentrated; the latter is usually picked early to retain acidity in exchange for not having ripened its phenolic characteristics. But both grapes tend to straddle the middle parts of the scale \u2013 arguably, they hardly reach the low or high scale of anything, including their intensity \u2013 they\u2019re safe, pleasantly-sounding grapes, and my classmate cleverly named it the \u201cbaby bear\u2019s oatmeal of the wine world\u201d. This wine in particular is somewhere in between the full Alsatian style and the lighter, more neutral fruit-driven ones of Italy. So, a good example. Pinot Grigio is eye roll-inducing, but it\u2019s definitely worth exploring the Gris side of this Pinot. I\u2019ve had stunning examples from Alsace \u2013 the fuller-bodied concentrated examples are nothing to shake a stick at; I\u2019ve seen interesting examples from BC as well.

The acidity isn\u2019t fresh, but it\u2019s there, and it\u2019s enough to keep things balanced. Makes sense though \u2013 it\u2019s Viognier. And of course, the typical slightly imbalanced phenolic bitterness that Viognier can have \u2013 common and hard to pull off. All in all, think Californian (or Australian) Viognier with a little more elegance. There is a lightness to the wine despite the viscosity \u2013 the balance isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s good enough. I must be missing something \u2013 vineyards close to the water for moderated temperatures, high altitudes, or short-lived vines \u2013 because India has a strikingly hotter climate compared to the other winemaking regions on the planet, which can equate to vines that tire themselves out without the winter to build up carbohydrate reserves. Or, an interesting amount of alcoholic photoshop to the wine. Who knows. I\u2019m interested, but I can\u2019t find a spec sheet, or I\u2019m too lazy to really try. Because it\u2019s 1AM on a Saturday night and all I want to do is drink wine and be as flabby as Viognier can be. I\u2019m sort of impressed. And satiated. I\u2019m ready to move on to chilled Sauvignon Blanc, because damn \u2013 this humid Vancouver summer sure calls for it.

I had thought this was more neutral at first \u2013 perhaps it needed to warm up. But the floral characteristic with spice and soft expressions of stone/tropical fruit would lead this to Viognier. After having tasted the German Pinot Blanc, I was so sure that this wasn\u2019t Viognier. Texture-wise, this is a much more fresh expression to what I expected \u2013 Oz Clarke\u2019s verbal paintings of voluptuous fruit and enticing creamy notes lead me to believe that the Pinot Blanc was Viognier. Washington is the one of the last places I would expect this from \u2013 a calmer more mineral tone lead me to believe that this was certainly a cooler climate (and perhaps even Old World), but it lacked a bit more flamboyance than I would expect, although there was more intensity on the nose and palate than I had originally noted. Suddenly Washington makes sense, but I hardly knew they grew Viognier there. Viognier is a grape quite known for its phenolic characteristics: an example of a grape that maybe needs more care in vinification opposed to its growing, due to a common bitterness that it might have. This makes sense. I\u2019ve hardly come across many affordable Viogniers that I\u2019ve fallen for. Condrieu is on the spit bucket list. Although less loud than I had expected, this style of Viognier reminds me of some of the Pays d\u2019Oc versions I\u2019ve had, but better. The less impressive restrained versions have had that imbalanced mineral savoury bitterness without much fruit and balance. Australia seems to be pleasantly surprising to me, and is perhaps less of a gamble when it comes to Oz Clarke\u2019s poetic descriptions of the grape \u2013 but this is just based on what I\u2019ve had so far.

So on some last Tuesday of some sort, we were supposed to have practice (I love referring to practice\u00a0blind tasting sessions as such because it sounds like I\u2019m vaguely into sports) but it was cancelled because there\u2019s a bit of a cold going around. The viruses have decided disregard\u00a0me over the past few months so I\u2019m lucky, and that\u2019s saying something when you\u2019re in retail because\u00a0you\u2019re basically touching everyone. I\u2019ll get it at the worst time, I\u2019m sure. That one birthday when I invited my friends over but was wrapped up in a blanket the whole time. I hopped onto the 2015 Vancouver Wine Festival tickets slightly\u00a0more ravenously than I did for Lady Gaga concert tickets last year, even though I\u2019m not supremely stoked that Australia is the theme country. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I absolutely love Australia, but part of me\u00a0fears that each seminar will leave my mouth feeling stained and used. I suppose I\u2019m doing myself a disservice by expecting exactly what everyone else is thinking, but I guess that\u2019s why there are\u00a0all the cool seminars having to do with exploring different terroirs, and weird varietals grown in Australia and other cool shit. I\u2019m into it. According to my credit card. Led a blind tasting with my colleague at UBC the other day. Daunted by the purported amount of people attending on the Facebook event, it was bittersweet to find out that not as many people showed up (because it\u2019s cool to say you\u2019re going and then not go or whatever). It was fun though: we featured four wines and had flavour elements laid out everywhere throughout the art gallery, having people match up flavours to the wines. We also did this last-minute thing where we had people write collective tasting notes on this big sheet of paper (which was really just the back of an old 2014 Decanter calendar). Success, I think. Also, cool art and stuff.    INVASIVE! It\u2019s \u201cberry\u201d good. The right people came to this. Also, my best friend was there\u00a0<3 And somewhere on the weekend I went to a friend\u2018s place\u00a0for dinner after work. We had rice bowls. And I enjoyed it. Because rice. And bowls. And good cooking. And meeting new people. And laughter. And pomegranates. There was both beer and wine, but I decided to go right for the wine, being the pretentious fuck that I am, and the Anselmi San Vincenzo provided just enough light for that bridge between work and, well, anything but. (Does sucking in your gut count as work?)\u00a0Then there was the Brokenwood 2006 IRL Reserve S\u00e9millon, which, hello. Pikachu: lightweight, lithe, chewing on electricity.\u00a0There was the\u00a0Vereinigte Hospitien 1990 \u201cSanctus Jacobus\u201d Graacher Domprobst Riesling Auslese which I made people taste blindly, because I am a monster that likes to ruin the rhythm of a good evening. Like a clogged toilet.  Charcoal filter, cheese, spice, sunsets. Tasting notes, not an insane grocery list. We finished with this weird non-vintaged beauty that smelled of Christmas and applesauce. The Jean Bourdy Galant des Abbesses is a gentle beast from Jura, and it\u2019s made from must that\u2019s been charged with herbs and spices, then fortified with marc de Jura. Swoon. Class was decent. We had 6 wines instead of 7 because of time (we still went 15 minutes over anyways), but also thank god because tannin galore. Central Italy has some powerful and dagger-like\u00a0reds, and it\u2019s almost like they need the refreshing, neutral, and almost bland white wines to balance out the superlatives. Meh. Though the first of our whites (Fontaleoni 2013 Vernacchia di San Gimignano, $18) was a little more characterful than the blander second (Ruffino 2013 Orvieto Classico, $13), it was argued that the Vernacchia was perhaps just slightly more oxidized than it should be, but\u00a0hey:\u00a0it added character. The reds are where it got more interesting: we were told that we would be\u00a0given four reds\u00a0from the same region, and it was up to us to determine which region and what wines they were. (Tuscany, obviously.) Awkwardly enough, I thought the most expensive wine in the flight (Gianni Brunelli \u201cLe Chiuse di Sotto\u201d Brunello di Montalcino, $99) was the one of the least best\u00a0quality:\u00a0it\u00a0seemed the lightest in body, but perhaps the better description\u00a0is that it was the most elegant of the flight. Guessed it as a Chianti Classico that lacked a bit of concentration and complexity, but I\u2019m often prey to the gustatory equivalents of optical illusions.\u00a0I suck. The second wine (Viticcio 2010 Chianti Classico Riserva, $40) was markedly floral and dominated with Sangiovese on paper, but the expression was much more modern and dark in its fruit. Lots of dusty violet character along with plums, black cherries, and very-well integrated oak. There\u2019s a much more viscous mouthfeel and slight shortfall\u00a0of poise, an outfit\u00a0which\u00a0I found\u00a0similar to the third red (Poliziano 2010 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, $40), though I found flavours here much more textbook Sangiovese: sour\u00a0cherry, dried red fruit, sage, and tomato leaf.\u00a0I originally guessed that this one was the Brunello, but that was before I realized I had gotten the first two wines wrong. I changed my conclusion as I was reading out my tasting note, and I villainously beamed when the instructor said I nailed the\u00a0wine, but I\u2019m a Sangio-phony. Ohhhh! The last was the wine with that obvious cassis bend (Tenuta San Guido 2011 \u201cGuidalberto\u201d Toscana, $60), heavily suggesting something with Cab. Probably the most brooding and bearish of the four red wines, and the fullest body but perhaps tight in the slightest. Lots of opulence on the nose: spice, menthol, plum, dried black cherry, cassis, and a hint of game. My wine girlfriend\u00a0is coming to visit on Monday for her birthday.

Three cheers for my liver, and insert that link here. That link\u00a0everyone\u2019s been sharing on Facebook about how a glass of wine equals an hour at gym or whatever etc etc etc  I read this book called \u201cWine Politics\u201d by Tyler Colman aka Dr. Vino. The first bit was good but very history-laden (the book focusses on France and the US), and the latter parts discussed lots of contemporary issues involving governmental structure, appellation law, wine popularity, wine critics, and\u00a0evolving attitudes. Really entertaining and informative if not a bit depressing, seeing how so much of the market is controlled by such big and rich companies who sell monochromatic wine. After I finished the book I felt much more enlightened yet grey clouds started to form as if I\u2019d just bitten into forbidden grapes\u00a0from the Garden of Eden. Beer that\u2019s delicious; wine that\u2019s auspicious #drunkreading Class was about the South of France and South America, not only in terms of wine but business as well. 9 wines. Oi. Some of them were shit so I guess you gotta make up for it. The non-vintaged Concha Y Toro \u201cFrontera\u201d Merlot ($9) was impressive in my opinion, with a bit of gentle greenness and simple plum, showing \u2013 at least \u2013 some varietal character despite its bareness. The J.P. Chenet 2013 Pinot Noir ($14), on the other hand, was confected and sort of gross, being simultaneously unripe yet disjointedly and artificially ripe\u00a0at the same time. I once worked at a store that sold this regularly, and one colleague bought this often because it \u201clooked expensive\u201d and he thought it impressed his girlfriend or something. K. Two blends from the south of France were next: the\u00a0Domaine Modat 2010 C\u00f4tes du Roussillon Villages Caramany ($39) was notably textured and brawny, with lots of evolved black fruit and spice, while the\u00a0Hecht & Bannier 2011 Saint-Chinian ($30) had more tar and garrigue notes to display, though its body was a bit lighter. Some whites in the middle to refresh our palates I suppose (though I thought both of them were kinda gross), and despite their blandness they illustrated something, at least, with the French Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2013 Sauvignon Blanc ($13) showing much less grassy character than the Chilean\u00a0Veramonte 2013 Sauvignon Blanc ($14), because the grapes from the former\u00a0were grown in a much generally warmer and thus less suitable climate for Savvy Blanc. I didn\u2019t even pick up on the grassiness in the first wine (why are tasting Pinot Grigio in this class?) and so I ventured a vague guess of Picpoul. I still think the Chilean wine was kinda only okay but I\u2019d pick it over that first one any day. Carmenere was bound to appear somewhere in the flight, with its tomato soup head evaporating from the glass and into all of our noses.

And yet, the grape still has a spectrum, even if a small one \u2013 the softer and friendlier Asti versions, to the darker, serious ones of the Alba \u2013 both areas in Piedmont.

So the wine I was blinded with today was quite solid and delicious. At first, the nose was quite smoky in that delicate sense, without overpowering too much of the fruit. Now \u2013 although I\u2019ve had a lot of wines (l0l), I still have trouble telling the difference between certain descriptions like oak and spice, but I was pretty sure there was some level of oak in this wine (which I found out later was Slovenian, which I\u2019m not particularly familiar with). The fruit was subdued at first, and opened up after we let it sit for a while. There were some obvious cherry notes, with a bit of bright strawberry and vanilla, like what you get from red fruit roll-ups or fruit-to-go. The smokiness on the nose almost drew me to something Syrah-like, but the palate revealed otherwise. Definitely Old World on the nose. The palate was quite expressive (i.e. the opposite of tight). I found the smoky nose almost disjointed (or unexpected, rather, since I haven\u2019t had much Barbera) with the relatively light body and tannin, and higher acidity. What stuck out to me, along with the beautifully integrated acidity, was the savoury peppery finish, and I was almost tempted to guess Spain, but Italy was where I eventually landed, and was correct. The Barbera grape was my final (and correct!) guess. Botched the year though. Guessed \u201906 and beyond backwards, but finally guessed \u201909 after like seven guesses. I got too excited. That being said \u2013 this was great. I haven\u2019t had much Barbera \u2013 but I can say with confidence that this is a good wine. Quite expressive, and I would even age this, but not for very long (1-3 years?). Quite elegant. The acidity is well-integrated.

A clear, almost colourless wine. I wasn\u2019t sure whether or not the hint of peachiness in the wine was due to the red stains in the wine glasses we were using or because of some strangely coloured grape. Like Gewurztraminer. The nose was weird. I captured little to no fruit \u2013 just an ethanol-like spice, a slight neutral vanilla fruitiness, and neutral wood. Further smelling revealed a flutter of apples and more notably, nuts. Vague floral notes. Not aromatic. A generally restrained character, and I determined that it was Old World \u2013 no doubt that this wouldn\u2019t be from the realm of the New. Two colleagues guessed Chenin \u2013 notes of wet wool and river stones were mentioned. Gr\u00fcner, is that you? Maybe. Not enough acidity or life. Gr\u00fcner is like that talkative friend. This wine is pretty closed. Similar on the palate: restrained yet round, but not oily. A mineral and a subtle tongue-coating citrus pith flavour almost cancels out the medium acidity, but isn\u2019t cloying because there\u2019s not much to cloy, except a slight alcohol warmth. The alcohol is not low. By no means did this wine seem anything that fit the diverse French moulds, nor the aromatic whites of Spain and Germany. Despite the lack in crispness, Italy seemed to be the one, with the all-neutral everything. Apparently correct. Looking back at my grape chart, guesses of Fiano or Falanghina (whatever the hell that is) probably would\u2019ve been the closest (due to mere descriptions). My guesses started with Arneis, then trailed on to Vermentino, Verdicchio, Pinot Grigio, Trebbiano, and then from there I attempted to just name all the white Italian grapes I knew. Chardonnay-like, even. Who\u2019d\u2019ve thunk that this would be a Sangiovese (a red grape) without the red?! Crazy. Nerdy, even. Weird, especially because red Sangiovese typically has an undeniable aromatic savoury cherry character. Skins are important! Push down those grape skins. Pump them over. Oh, yes. It\u2019s funny, because I always jokingly guess white Sangiovese whenever I\u2019m blinded with a white, but this is the one time it took me forever to get it. I\u2019ve had this wine be described to me before: memorable descriptions of red fruit have me believe that this wine is at it\u2019s peak or over the hill (or that the taster might\u2019ve been primed to pick up red fruit). If I was blindfolded, I\u2019m pretty sure it would\u2019ve been hard for me to guess the colour of the wine. In this wine, secondary characteristics reign! If this wine isn\u2019t weird to you, it should be. Sangiovese without the red is sort of like a hot dog without the bun, a pizza without tomato sauce, or a college party without alcohol. Doable.

Purer red fruit, for example, in Barbera d\u2019Asti, and a bit spicier and darker in Barbera d\u2019Alba, sort of like how you can get estery\u00a0Gamay from Beaujolais Nouveau over to the earthier and grittier cru Beaujolais like this one. And suddenly my Sansa Stark = Cru Beaujolais and Arya Stark = Barbera d\u2019Alba analogy sort of makes more sense. This wasn\u2019t as complex as a Sansa Stark though.\u00a0Spicy red fruits, yes, and a nice glowing acidity, but mostly fresh, and just fresh \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s hard to be a fresh red. Thats the selling point of this one. The three reds in this flight were chosen to display different textures of tannin: in this wine, the tannins weren\u2019t exactly high by any means but were a bit coarse and astringent despite being sparse. We would then contrast this to the second wine, a 12-year-old Rioja Reserva, which had present yet chalky tannins, and then the third was a Syrah-based blend from Chile, which was intense and tannic \u2013 but was soft all at the same time. I guessed this as Barbera, as did the classmate who was reading out his notes, probably due to the high acid and the hint of earthy scratch on the palate. Maybe not my favourite Cru Beaujolais, but the underdog region endlessly fascinates me and this is the first time I\u2019ve consciously tried one from R\u00e9gni\u00e9 (though I remember bringing one to a wine tasting, perhaps), which has been\u00a0the newest Cru of the region since 1988, rounding out the number of Cru Beaujolais up to 10. Which just sort of feels right. I mean, 9 is a great square\u00a0number (and I love me a good square number), but there\u2019s just something about referring to the 10 Cru Beaujolais as the 10 Cru Beaujolais which feels a little more royal, and the region just needs a bit more royal in it.    \u00a0", "harvested_from": "http://www.joshlikeswine.com/2014/10/08/2012-maison-des-bulliats-regnie/", "count": 1, "mouth": "dry, med- body, high acid, med- coarse/astringent tannin, med alcohol, med length, med flavour intensity, raspberry, cherry, sour plum, spice", "eyes": "clear, med ruby, legs", "abv": "\u00a012.5%", "nose": "clean, med intensity, youthful, red fruit, raspberry, cherry, spice, cinnamon, pepper", "region": "France", "price": "\u00a022", "variety": "Gamay", "vintage": "\u00a02012", "sub_region": "R\u00e9gni\u00e9 AOP, Beaujolais", "producer": "Maison des Bulliats"}, {"name": "Jean Foillard 2011 \u201cC\u00f4te du Py\u201d Morgon", "overall": "Very good quality: although perhaps too funky for some, the complex Cru Beaujolais had great balance between fruit and structure, and the velvety mouthfeel showed intensity and concentration.

Floral characteristics are usually not my cup of tea. I am immediately reminded of Torrontes, Gewurztraminer, jasmine-flavoured beer, and soap. That being said, both the fruits (cherry, raspberry) and the non-fruits (earth, mustiness, spice) were satisfied hanging with each other in the glass, and the high acid on the palate was well-balanced. The tannin must have been as well, because it was lower than I had recorded, me putting down med- while the instructor agreed on med. Some of my classmates put this as very good quality.

In the first few wafts\u00a0of the wine, you get this intoxicating and familiar savoury soy characteristic which sort of masks the dried red fruit and makes it seem more brooding than it is.

Petite Sirah, a crossing between 1880 Peloursin and Syrah (also called Durif). I\u2019ve never loved a wine that Petite Sirah has touched \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual to find this in a jammy (and sometimes confected or even off-dry) Californian Red; more than a few examples have been enough to condition me away from it. How dangerous. \u00a0Courageous hipster grape evangelizers like Jennifer-Simonetti Bryan MW (who recommends the Bogle Petite Sirah in so many of her articles and interviews) always kept my mind open. To me, Petite Sirah is to Zinfandel and Syrah as Pinot Blanc is to Chardonnay and Pinot Gris \u2013 there are some common links, but the latter grape lives in the shadows and the good (and apparently sometimes long-lived, for Petite Sirah) examples of the grape can be tough to find in some markets \u2013 but they exist, and they are\u00a0justifiably\u00a0good. Back to the grape analogy \u2013 Petite Sirah has that baked fruit characteristic that you might find in a grape like Zinfandel, but can still have more structured mouthfeel which is more akin to Syrah. This wine is a good example of a sub-20 version: baked red and black fruit supported by vanilla and cloves. The palate echoes the flavours, but the structure might be deceiving for those who expect a texture as soft and easy as the jam flavours: instead, a large amount of ripe tannins and a well-balanced acidity structure out the wine, but the finish is a little imbalanced. There is a slight bitter attack and a bit of a persistence of such flavouring throughout, but it\u2019s inoffensive and generally contributes to a rougher character.

What a shame, because this was a terrific wine. It\u2019s a confusion as to why I can hardly find information on this Ch\u00e2teau on both the internet and in Oz Clarke\u2019s most recent Bordeaux compendium. Ninja Bordeaux? Of the four most known appellations of left bank Bordeaux, Saint-Est\u00e8phe is probably the hipster of the four \u2013 where Pauillac is known for its power and Margaux for its silkiness (and small Saint-Julien for his balance between the two), Saint-Est\u00e8phe finds character in what Oz Clarke describes as \u201can earthy scratch to the texture, no matter how refined the estate nor how well matured the wine might be\u201d. Though the appellation can also have the reputation for being the slowest to mature, the wines tend to be of great value \u2013 like this one, I would argue, at $48. Despite the time that some Saint-Est\u00e8phe needs, we do find more instant drinkers in riper years like this one, and a discussion in class about age was brought up. One argued that this would peak in about 5 years, where there would be a nice balance between fruit and famous aged Bordeaux characteristics \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to generalize when preferences differ. Chosen to display a blend of three grapes we studied today (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc, and I suppose Petit Verdot), this wine was impressive with a good structure, long length, and a concentrated palate, equating to being on the higher end of \u201cvery good\u201d or the lower end of \u201coutstanding\u201d. Further complexity and a more harmonized alcohol would give it a higher quality, although it\u2019s already pretty damn good to begin with.\u00a0I noticed a bit of that Saint-Estephe abrasiveness but that might have been the power of suggestion. Oh \u2013 and despite my cold, I pretty much nailed all the non-flavour parameters. Insert fist pump here. For some reason I find myself fascinated with this part of Bordeaux opposed to the others, and it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that Tom Stevenson of The Sotheby\u2019s Wine Encyclopedia describes Saint-Est\u00e8phe as the \u201cleast sexy of the M\u00e9doc\u2019s famous four appellations\u201d.

(Wow, invite me over already and I\u2019ll bring the pizza.) The grape is an early budder and late ripener, and therefore needs sunlight and heat. It\u2019s also a plump grape with thin skins, which equates to a fuller body without being too tannically textured, and let\u2019s not forget about how much alcohol the grape can pump out as a result of its own gut. The grape isn\u2019t often impressively intense in flavours, but all these reasons are exactly why Grenache is often blended. Grenache is Type B, while Syrah adds sass. And then there are the backup singers. There was ripe and candied red fruit from this wine, mostly, only helping the image of a lazy summer. There was a bit of spice and what a classmate cleverly picked up as peppermint chocolate, but the wine was devoid of the leather and flowers I often pick up in the old world counterparts. I\u2019m not complaining, though \u2013 that whole first paragraph sounds really appealing to me right about now.    \u00a0", "harvested_from": "http://www.joshlikeswine.com/2014/12/07/yalumba-2013-old-bush-vine-grenache/", "count": 1, "mouth": "dry, med+ body, med intensity, med acid, med+ alcohol, baked red fruit, ripe strawberry, gumminess, med very fine tannin, med length", "eyes": "clear, med ruby, legs", "abv": "\u00a014.5%", "nose": "clean, med intensity, youthful, sweet red fruit, baked strawberry, spice, white pepper, candied red fruit, hint floral, peppermint", "region": "Australia", "price": "\u00a025", "variety": "Grenache", "vintage": "\u00a02013", "sub_region": "Barossa Valley, South Australia", "producer": "Yalumba"}]}, {"name": "N/A", "children": [{"name": "I NEED A BIGGER KNIFE.

Doesn\u2019t seem so bad in retrospect, but I woke up early for a 9AM thing at UBC, took the 99 to the last stop for work, and then needed to travel all the way back to UBC to lead Part 2 of the sort-of-intro-to-wine themed tasting, all while wearing pants that weren\u2019t jeans, one of those shirts you\u2019d hate to spill wine on, and shoes that didn\u2019t fit just enough to make my feet cry. The garb was fitting for all of the day\u2019s events but for this day in particular, I would defs have lead a wine tasting wearing nothing but seven layers of random comfortable 7-foot-long linens, cinnamon-bun-Homer-Simpson style. I was that uncomfortable (ugh rain + sickness). Except I\u2019ve watched enough Project Runway to know that I\u2019d be judged by someone with a German accent. Walk of shame out of the room from elimination. America\u2019s Next Top Wine Tasting? legit For this tasting we tried a French Sauvignon Blanc, an Argentinian Syrah, a Ros\u00e9 Cr\u00e9mant from Burgundy, and an Italian Brachetto. The former two because they were the noble grapes we hadn\u2019t discussed yet, and the latter two because they were fun and why not. Yay! Along with that whole idea of matching up grape varieties with personalities: Sauvignon Blanc reminds me of an outdoorsy person, and Syrah/Shiraz, the mysterious one. These are probably one of my more fitting comparisons, seeing as Sauvignon Blanc typically has grassy and citrus notes, while Syrah can have red fruit, black fruit, but with a common touch of smokiness or black pepper. Back when one of my best friends bought me a bottle of Syrah for my birthday, I decided to write my first tasting note, knowing jack shit about wine. One of the first things I wrote was \u201ccampfire\u201d, which I learned wasn\u2019t totally off. Sauvignon Blanc, while seemingly specific in its characteristics, can definitely vary in character. Razor sharp and mineral-driven versions can be found in the Loire (which I call home to the hipster grape varieties in France), along with mellower versions around Bordeaux, some of which bridge the Old World-New World styles. New Zealand and Chile are examples of notable and amazing regions in which Sauv Blanc can be produced in that aromatic, grassy, and outgoing style opposed to the more elegant and almost furtive style of the Old World. Generally a great seafood pairing, for sure. True story Other things that happened (and which you should feel bad for missing out on) included me eventually succeeding at sabring a bottle of Cr\u00e9mant (hence the title), some kind of grape-eating game, and a push-up contest. It was fun, but I\u2019m not even sure if most of that happened and perhaps the alcohol and long day combined to give me Freudian hallucinations. (Oh well.) AND bread(crumbs)!   Okay, so I lied. This wine is not Sauv Blanc dominated but has other grapes like Colombard and Ugni Blanc, both which provide body and a fruitiness that is reminiscent of a New World wine but still made in that Old World style. Dry, medium-bodied, medium+ acidity, and aromas of grapefruit, citrus, and someone else pointed out that they got pineapple, which is normally weird to get out of Sauvignon Blanc but not out of the question because of the random slosh of grapes thrown into this wine. I also heard honey which I totally see as well. I can see this going well with seafood, but I can also see this going well with a failed midterm and a subpar subsequent pep talk. 15 buckaroos is good for this wine.   This was an interesting one. Definitely fruitier than I expected, but still had that Syrah smokiness. Common descriptors included raspberry, black cherry, and coffee, all which I was proud to hear. Definitely bridges the Old World-New World style much in the same way that the first wine does. Dry, medium-bodied, medium to medium+ acidity, medium tannins. I think. Meatier for sure \u2013 I wish the length was a bit longer on this, but otherwise this ain\u2019t bad for 17 bones.   I\u2019m known at work for being a ros\u00e9-hater. Confession: I don\u2019t know \u2013 when I want a ros\u00e9 \u2013 I do, more than half the wine, want a fruity ros\u00e9, and not that savoury shit you get out of most serious ros\u00e9s like this one. I can\u2019t help it \u2013 to me, pink shouts fun and almost into that \u00a0off-dry territory, and I psychologically expect that. That being said, this wine super good for its category, and had great light red fruit notes along with that savoury and long finish. Also, this was the point in time where I started paying less and less attention to tasting notes. 27 dollars and very French. Great bubbs. Fantastic value for celebration. 4) NV Toso Brachetto d\u2019Acqui  This was a popular one. Sparkling sweet red \u2013 lower in alcohol, probably as a result of an interrupted fermentation (or maybe the Asti method). Quite similar to Moscato with a red fruit kick \u2013 almost similar to Lambrusco (in theory \u2013 I\u2019ve never had one). Things I heard included strawberries, raspberries, cranberry juice, and raisins. So yeah \u2013 basically red sweet fruit on the nose and that dried jammy fruit character on the palate, especially on the finish. Medium-sweet to sweet and medium-bodied, but had a rather low acidity which was thankfully uplifted by some of the sparkle to prevent that cloying character. Quite popular with the group and it\u2019s weird to see the huge general contrast in tastes to people that I serve at the wine store. 20 bucks. But yeah! That\u2019s it for this tasting. For the next session, we\u2019re trying wines that pair with a zombie apocalypse.

The answer is maybe. Anyways, I\u2019m told I have like half an hour before we leave for breakfast. It\u2019s finally the day that the pre-excursion for the Wine Bloggers Conference 2015 starts \u2013 so Christine, Amy, Leeann, Sujinder and I pack up, eat breakfast at a place (i.e. delicious instant-regret-omelettes), and drive back to Elmira where some of us\u00a0enjoy Gin and Tonics at the airport to revitalize our brains. Some fellow bloggers\u00a0began arriving: some remember that we met last year, where I was plagued by lots of self-doubt more than the capacity to retain faces and names\u00a0(ugh what a great start), and we all board the pre-excursion bus on the way to Villa Bellangelo. Hi, my name is Josh. Oh, we\u2019ve met before? Do I, like, awkwardly take back my business card or? Swag swag swag and goodies are what we begin with, and also bumpy bus rides involving wine! We\u2019re given\u00a0glasses but also spit cups \u2013 we soon discover that none of us really has enough limbs to hold anything, so Christine and I share a waste cup\u00a0with one of our four hands. At one point our bus avoids a collision and someone\u2019s spit cup goes flying and I swear that I feel a\u00a0splash on my right calf. Rock Stream 2013 Dry Cayuga White (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $13\nApparently, the Cayuga White grape is a Riesling lookalike. Hay and lemons on the nose. Relatively Riesling-like on the palate, I guess, with vague piercing citrus. Rock Stream 2013 Dry Riesling\u00a0(Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $15\nDusty floral perfume on the nose \u2013 almost rosemary. A burst of lemon tea on the palate with a pale finish. Rock Stream 2010 Cabernet Franc (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nThe nose reveals mostly meaty tomato leaf, menthol, and a bit of cherry. Velvety cooked raspberries on the palate\u00a0with zippy black cherry and fine light tannin. Seneca Shore Pinot Grigio (Finger Lakes, New York) $15\nA bit of SO2 on the nose? Crisp and fresh lemon seed on the palate, maybe a hint\u00a0of grapefruit? Correct if not slightly dull but maybe needs to open up. Seneca Shore Riesling Semi-Dry (Finger Lakes, New York) $13\nMuted. A bit stony \u2013 herbaceous maybe? Quite zippy and electric and much drier than I expected. Seneca Shore Queen Charlene\u2019s Dry Ros\u00e9 (Finger Lakes, New York) $12\n100% Pinot Noir, and named after the winemaker\u2019s wife or something kind of cute. Almost like a still version of a particular Cr\u00e9mant ros\u00e9, with a lightly floral nose, red fruit, and ripe pear. Easily the best of the Seneca Shore\u00a0wines we tasted by far. We\u2019re warmly greeted at the beautiful Villa Bellangelo, where a glass of ros\u00e9 and an opening speech by Chris Missick (owner) is followed by four stations: an area with bits and bites, a\u00a0station with a flight of Riesling, a station with something like a 10-year vertical of Cabernet Sauvignon (immediate gasp from the group of bloggers) from\u00a0King\u2019s Garden Vineyards, and a sort of in-between miscellaneous Villa Bellangelo table. My current emotion: enjoying life with shorts that need ironing. Also, that\u2019s a tube of lip balm. I\u2019m stubborn so I come with the mission to try and\u00a0taste everything. Everyone obviously goes to the table with the Cab vertical and I\u00a0rush right over to the Riesling table because in this moment I am a Riesling cheerleader sporting\u00a0a sleeveless shirt instead of a short skirt. I\u2019m absorbed\u00a0and focussed to the point where a fellow blogger approaches the table, places\u00a0her hand on my shoulder, and jokingly\u00a0tells me I don\u2019t\u00a0need to hog the space. In my mind I was having a Real Housewines of New York confessional monologue about how I couldn\u2019t believe I was dealing with this instead of taking a picture of myself outside on the patio milking a\u00a0goat, but I knew she was mostly jesting and\u00a0okay fine maybe I was hogging the table shh. I made it partway through the miscellaneous table before we were told our time was up.\u00a0Ugh \u2013 this is interrupted elementary school recess all over again. Also, click here to see local coverage on this particular event including a partially flattering one-second clip of me jotting something down. Yes. Bellangelo 2013 Ros\u00e9 (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York)\u00a0$13\n30% Pinot Noir, 30% Cabernet Franc, 40% Chardonnay. Flowers, watermelon, and pear, maybe a hint of raspberry bubble gum. Dry, light, pretty. Rieslings, poured by Dan Bissell (assistant winemaker) and Nathan Kendall (head winemaker): Bellangelo 2012 Dry Riesling\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $19\nAND SO IT BEGINS. Lime and liquid stones. Glacial and icy, sort of like Meryl Streep in the Devil Wears Prada? Bellangelo 2013 Dry Riesling\u00a0(Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $18\n7% aged in neutral French\u00a0oak for 3 months. A little more honeyed and friendly, but still mostly edgy lime. So like Meryl Streep\u00a0towards the end of said\u00a0movie. Bellangelo 2014 Dry Riesling\u00a0(Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nDefinitely has the\u00a0most fruit intensity of the Dry Rieslings, with some grass and grapefruit reminiscent of Sauvignon Blanc. Some Granny Smith apple here and there. Unreleased? Bellangelo 2012 \u201c1866 Reserve\u201d Riesling\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $32\nWe glide\u00a0into petrol territory here, with an off-dryness accented by peach and lemon. Elegant and gossamer\u00a0but taut and concentrated. Bellangelo 2012 Riesling Semi Dry\u00a0(Finger Lakes New York) $?\nA hint of something slightly skunky or herbaceous though I\u2019m still sort of into it. There\u2019s a pinch of\u00a0well-balanced sweetness with some\u00a0stone fruit. Bellangelo 2011 Riesling Semi Dry\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nA bit muted fruit on the nose with something smoky, and then there\u2019s an intriguing\u00a0meatiness on the palate that replaces the colourfulness in previous examples. Bellangelo 2014 Riesling [dropped \u201csemi-dry\u201d designation] (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nLeafy, stony, with lots of grapefruit and even a hint of durian. Off-dry but quite bright. Bellangelo 2013 Riesling Semi Dry\u00a0(Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $18\n17% aged in neutral French oak for three months. Quiet\u00a0stone fruit, something pollen-like, and\u00a0muted honey. Medium-dry and textured; definitely the most slutty of the lot. Lots of lime and margarita and things. Is \u201csemi-dry\u201d starting to sound like a really good baby name or no? Bellangelo 2012 \u201cGibson Vineyard\u201d Riesling\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $22\nA bit shy on the nose, but then an explosion of honeyed white peach on the palate. Interested to see what this could do with age. I might lazily re-use a terrible \u201cRiesling to the occasion\u201d joke. And, the others, poured by Becky (friendly knowledgable awesome human): Bellangelo 2013 Dry Chardonnay\u00a0(Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nLarge proportion was oaked for 8 months with full malolactic fermentation. Reminds me of that Connecticut Chardonnay I had just a couple of days ago: steely but buttery with\u00a0oak. Personally, I could use more fruit intensity to balance the scale. Bellangelo 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay\u00a0(Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $15\n30% Chardonnay Musqu\u00e9. Skunky? Maybe a hint of cork taint? I doubt myself so I made some other friends smell this and we agreed that the particular bottle was maybe off but we couldn\u2019t agree on why. Need to retry. Bellangelo 2013 \u201c1866 Reserve\u201d Gewurztraminer\u00a0(Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $32\nClassy and a bit more more hushed for Gew. One sniff and I\u2019m pretty sure I was transported to someone\u2019s grandma\u2019s\u00a0quaint bathroom that smells dainty and floral and definitely has a pastel colour palate along with a fuzzy pink toilet cover. Aged in neutral French oak for 10 months. Bellangelo 2012 Gewurztraminer\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nStill elegant but spicier rather than flowery. Off-dry but barely, and with stony restraint. I vibe with this wine. Bellangelo 2013 Seyval Blanc\u00a0(Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $16\nLovely and graceful with something buttery but not quite? Greek yoghurt perhaps? Odd because this has been aged in 100% stainless steel with no malolactic. Off-dry and intense lemon sorbet on the palate. I\u2019m impressed with a Seyval Blanc and I feel weird about it. Bellangelo \u201cBella Fresca\u201d $?\nChardonnay, Gewurztraminer, Seyval Blanc, Cayuga White, and Muscat \u2013 I think? Didn\u2019t get to spend much time with this and I don\u2019t trust my tasting note but this perhaps had a bit of a weird and slightly herbaceous character.

When Brandon Seager \u2013 the Chair of the Winemaking Department at Tompkins College, Winemaker, and Finger Lakes Wine Country LGBT Ambassador (cool, I didn\u2019t even know that was a thing!) \u2013 used Brad Pitt analogies and pictures to explain the nuances of wine aging, I knew that I had chosen the right seminar. Huzzah. The wines were what I was mostly looking forward to, especially the aged ice wine, which can be quite\u00a0a divisive topic when it comes to cellaring wine. Opponents of the idea believe that ice wine is\u00a0best drunk as fresh as possible, as fresh as newly-fallen snow to emphasize the bright and concentrated sweet flavours that bounce in the mouth with flashes of glitter and brightness. But our example was wonderfully delicious, with bright fruit replaced by more caramelized flavours. Perhaps\u00a0I need to rethink my thoughts when it comes to cellaring Canadian ice wine. Experiments are in order, obvi. Later that day, there was a casual tasting on the wines of the world. Brazilian wines? YES. Bring me there. And of course, I also decided to channel my energy into trying some Tuscan wines\u00a0before the week\u2019s conclusion. I needed some of that Old World Sangio in my life to balance out the week on\u00a0New York Riesling. This will by my last post on the 2015 Wine Bloggers Conference, I think (phew!). I did count\u00a0my tasting notes on the week\u00a0and it looks like\u00a0I had\u00a0190 in total, but\u00a0I\u2019ve cut it down to\u00a0133 due to some\u00a0illegibility (duh\u2026) among other reasons \u2013 which means, of course, that I\u2019m skipping writing about some events. Which sucks! But it happens. A great conference, and I can\u2019t wait for Lodi in 2016. \u201c\u2026and the worst. Beware of the Pinots.\u201d Hermann J. Weimer 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium lemon. Aromatics led by lime, citrus zest, and lots of a smoky chalky slaty character. That moment between dry and off-dry; there\u2019s more fruit on the palate expressed as zippy peach that dances on the tongue. Almost like hard candy. A bit shorter than I expected but still delicious. Dr. Konstantin Frank 2008 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York)\nGolden hue. Jammy apricots on the nose along with chalk and a scent I can only describe as weird flowers. Medium dry\u00a0and with fruit that\u2019s trying to claw its way through the refreshing acid. Honeyed at the end. Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium garnet. Mint and green pepper, along with dark chocolate, dried raspberries, soil, and a hint of soy sauce. Dry and velvety, bordering on the fuller side of things, with lighter slightly chalky tannin. Long\u00a0and suede-like. Casa Larga 2005 Fiori Delle Stelle Vidal Ice Wine (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium amber colour. Blast of caramelized mango and a bit of smoked fish (this combination:\u00a0Philippines, is that you?). Luscious with mouth-coating tropical fruit cooked in brown sugar. Long, and the acid doesn\u2019t fail to illuminate the wine.  Salton Brut (Serra Ga\u00facha, Brazil)\nPerfumed with lots of flowers and peach; off-dry and savoury with creamy mousse. Salton 2012 \u201cIntenso\u201d Cabernet Franc (Campanha, Brazil)\nCherry cola with hints of herbs. A bit sticky but pleasantly soft and warm. Salton 2012 \u201cIntenso\u201d Tannat (Campanha, Brazil)\nEarth, dark fruit, and blackberry skin; quite ripe in fruit with slightly chalky tannins. Quite open-knit with fair amounts of\u00a0glitz and glitter. Salton 2009 \u201cTalento\u201d (Campanha and Serra Ga\u00facha, Brazil)\nCabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Tannat. All of plums, mint, and spice. Very ripe and open, even unashamed and naked. Savoury. A bit over the brim. Villa Trasqua 2013 Toscana Rosso (Toscana, Italy)\nMostly Sangiovese with just a pinch of Alicante Bouschet. Though mainly consisting of dried red fruit, it\u2019s very soft, welcoming, and smiling. Almost seems un-Sangiovese-like but not without a bit of Italian scratch to the texture. Villa Trasqua 2011 \u201cEvoluto\u201d Chianti Classico (Chianti Classico, Toscana, Italy)\n95% Sangiovese with Colorino and Malvasia Nera. 18 months in Slavonian oak. Mostly sweaty plums, red fruit, cherry, and dried herbs. Ripe fruit contributing to the roundness, with a substantial amount of chalky structure. Villa Trasqua 2009 \u201cFanatico\u201d Chianti Classico Riserva (Chianti Classico, Toscana, Italy)\n100% Sangio. More spice, smoke, and fruit that tends over to the darker side of things. At this age it seems on its way to\u00a0loosening the ripe tannin, but it\u2019s still quite alive and ripe on the palate. Villa Trasqua 2007 \u201cNerento\u201d Chianti Classico Riserva\u00a0Gran Selezione (Chianti Classico, Toscana, Italy)\n100% Sangiovese; low yields, double guyot, and 30 months ageing. Gran Selezione: Chianti Classico\u2019s relatively new designation involving estate fruit and\u00a030 months of ageing. Here we go. There\u2019s a concentrated purity of that sour cherry Sangiovese sass that I seek. Some spice and tomato leaf but also some nice balancing fruit sweetness on the palate. Chalky textural love. Yes. Villa Trasqua 2008 \u201cTrasgaia\u201d Toscana Rosso (Toscana, Italy)\nCabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Sangiovese. Sweaty leather, nuts, cooked red fruit, and dried herbs. Very much open, extroverted and with a velvety texture that\u2019s balanced well with the tannic roughness. A pleasant hint of cooked veg on the palate. Villa Trasqua 2008 \u201cTrasolo\u201c\u00a0Toscana Rosso (Toscana, Italy)\n100% Merlot. Dark fruit, smoke, and earth. Ripe black fruits on the palate with a substantial amount of tannin. Savoury.

The grape is deceivingly pale in colour but is high in alcohol, acid, and tannin. Thus, it\u2019s supposed to be such a roughhouse, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s elegant despite the tannin. I often mistake the body for being lighter than it really it, even though 14.5% is blatantly high on the alcohol scale, inevitably leading to a heavier body. Classic aromas? I\u2019m reminded of the \u201ctar and roses\u201d mantra. But it\u2019s true \u2013 the dried foral elements often couple with this distinct dark forest-like earth. Sour red fruit and other savoury elements finish its personality. Nebbiolo is wholly masculine and feminine all at the same time \u2013 and as beautiful as it really sounds, it\u2019s a bit more than an acquired taste. It really is a wine geek\u2019s grape. Vietti is probably one of the most well known premium producers of Italian wines around these wine hills, and the Barbaresco was no exception. The tannins are high, coarse, and mouth-coating, almost right down to your lips, even in a riper year. But they\u2019re\u00a0strikingly\u00a0balanced. It\u2019s often said that Barbaresco is lighter and more elegant than Barolo, but some experts say that distinction is slowly greying out. I believe it. I\u2019ve had Barolo that were slightly softer in tannin, and some Barbaresco shows no mercy.

Did you see Australian\u00a0Gr\u00fcner Veltliner coming? The answer is no. You didn\u2019t. I mean yes \u2013 I tire my face\u00a0out by tensing my eye sockets and resisting an eye roll\u00a0every time someone says they \u201cdon\u2019t like Australian wine\u201d, which is somewhat fair considering that the market\u00a0can be\u00a0saturated with its own stereotypes.\u00a0I suppose it\u2019s just good business sense, but there\u2019s so much potential past the generic back-of-the-bottle tasting notes that preach deep berry\u00a0fruit, \u201csmooth\u201d, and an empty promise that it\u2019ll pair well with barbecue. Bitch, please. But a\u00a0handful of people raised their hand when the moderator for the event, Mark Davidson, asked the crowd if this was their first time tasting an Australian Pinot Noir. So it\u2019s possible that\u00a0everyone\u2019s pretty happy where everything is and I\u2019m just a combination of impatient and willing. And thirsty. So the theme is essentially anything weird or against the grain, whether it be international grapes grown on Australian soil or weird modern blends\u00a0or whatever. Really attracted to the whole\u00a0idea, and I think that this was\u00a0the seminar I was actually looking the most forward to.  Not sure if it was the power of suggestion, but even after revisiting the Nepenthe 2014 Winemaker\u2019s Selection Gr\u00fcner Veltliner after having tasted all of the wines, there was an intense celery root and white pepper flavour underlying the leesy lemon curd. Arguably more typical for the grape than other wines I\u2019ve seen from its regular home in Austria. I thought the slightly creamy body\u00a0added complexity but it was mentioned how this was \u201caccidental\u201d, and that in\u00a0future vintages they aim to make a fresher style made completely in stainless steel \u2013 there was some usage of (old?) oak barrels here that rounded out the more usual pointed character of Gr\u00fcn. The Tahbilk 2013 \u201cThe Tower\u201d MVR is a 60-25-15 blend of Marsanne, Viognier, and Roussanne. A Dream of Spring, mostly, with creamiscle and gardens, and a bit of a nectarine yogurt thing bringing visions of an Activia commercial. The palate is rounded with some tang on the mid-palate. Fairy lights.\u00a0The Gr\u00fcner from the previous wine illustrated new wines that were produced from vines only planted not more than a decade ago, but this wine was chosen to show that even pioneering wineries are still trying to push the envelope. Madonna, or something. A woman in the crowd\u00a0proclaimed that \u201cthat doesn\u2019t exist anymore\u201d, \u201cthat\u201d being the irritating Anything But Chardonnay notion\u00a0in the recent decade or so, as if the moderator had to issue some sort of a warning before people realized we were slated to taste a wine made from the terror-inducing Devil\u2019s Grape. If only it didn\u2019t exist, though \u2013 I still think a lot of people refuse to buy\u00a0it like it has gluten \u2013 but the Shaw + Smith 2013 \u201cM3\u201d Chardonnay was fantastic, with a distinctively non-fruity nose that mostly brought to mind the burnt bits at the bottom of the microwave popcorn bag, with hints of spicy citrus zest and grilled pineapple. Fuller and creamy but with acid to balance out the scales, and much more savoury citrus on the palate. Just a splash of malolactic. Part of the panel discussed\u00a0the much-used line that Chardonnay can do well anywhere, and that it\u2019s actually just as finicky as Pinot. I\u2019m inclined to debate, but I\u2019m not a grape-grower, so I\u2019ll shelve\u00a0the thought and let it grow.  The Yering Station 2012 Village Pinot Noir from the Mornington Peninsula had aromas of ripe red fruit with bits of white pepper and pomegranate. Same fruits on the palate with more of a soft floral component. Perhaps too lightweight for me but agreeable\u00a0and at least\u00a0part-hedonistic.\u00a0I\u2019ve tasted the Abel\u2019s Tempest 2012 Tasmania Pinot Noir before in class, but I\u2019m much more charmed by it this time around for some reason. Much more complex than I remember, with lots of red fruit. The fruit is less ripe but more dried compared to the Yering, along with some\u00a0spice, oak, and floral\u00a0perfume. Someone I know equates Malbec to tasting like pen ink or new shirt dye and I definitely don\u2019t blame him but now it\u2019s all I can think about when I taste the damn\u00a0grape. The Evans & Tate 2012 \u201cMetricup Road\u201d Malbec had this sort of inky asphalt entry with decaying leaves and asian spice along with blackberry skin and dust. For some reason it reminded me of a haunted house in the rain. Like mud and earth and dust and mysterious scrolls with fresh ink partially revealing clues to whoever murdered the blackberry merchant.\u00a0I\u2019m done. There\u2019s this one butcher shop on my street around which I mentally create a no-go radius, because there\u2019s this one particular spot that has a vent with these\u00a0acrid meaty fumes coming out of it. I swear that there\u2019s a hint of it in the Hardys 2012 \u201cThe Chronicles Butcher\u2019s Gold\u201d Shiraz Sangiovese (or is it just because I\u2019m seeing the word \u201cbutcher\u201d), but there\u2019s also lots of dried herb and a dusty gravel sort of aroma that makes it more pleasurable. Lots of structure here, and quite drying. The Peter Lehmann 2012 \u201cLayers Red\u201d is part southern Rh\u00f4ne cocktail and part Spanish Tempranillo. Mostly black cherry, cola, spice, dried flowers, and literally, a bit of what my glass smells like after I\u2019m finished with a particular\u00a0oaken gin. A sort of sweet cinnamon-herb smoke? Tannic but finely textured, and a vague smattering of both red and black fruits on the palate.  I was mostly excited to try the next three because they seemed the most fucked up of the flight (besides the Gr\u00fcn, and okay \u2013 the Malbec). I was actually really impressed by the McGuigan 2013\u00a0\u201cShortlist\u201d Barossa Valley Montepulciano \u2013 jellied but not jammy, if that makes sense? Lots of dark blueberry and hints of vanilla, dried herbs, and something animally. Quite structured at the end and some blood orange on the finish. A central Italian grape that I definitely don\u2019t drink enough of. The Hesketh 2014 Barossa Valley Touriga\u00a0had an interesting Viognier-like floral note of bergamot which was super cool. More spice, sweet black fruit, and some Froot Loops. Super structured like most things\u00a0in the flight, and quite concentrated. Personally, the most exciting wine in the flight (and perhaps of the whole festival), and of course it\u2019s not even available in our market. Yet. I haven\u2019t seen this flavour expression from the Touriga-based\u00a0wines of Portugal, from which the grape comes.\u00a0High hopes for this one, for sure. I definitely love that the Tar & Roses 2013 Tempranillo is bizarre and complex but there was something I wasn\u2019t completely into. There was lots of bold earth, raspberries, and tar, but there\u2019s a hint of medicinal cherry syrup\u00a0on the mouth that climbs\u00a0through the chalky\u00a0structure. I wrote down that it smells like someone\u2019s house. I don\u2019t get what I was trying to say. Of course Shiraz makes up the last wine in a seminar titled \u201cMod Oz\u201d. What the fuck is so ~*mOd oZ*~ about Shiraz? The Longview Vineyard 2010 \u201cThe Piece\u201d Shiraz is\u00a0delicious, with hints of eucalyptus, cola, black fruit, and some soy and leather showing age without veering into total soy sauce territory. Pronounced chalky tannin and a fair amount of acidity join a viscous body, along with oxidized black fruit. 2 years of very well-woven French oak. If I remember correctly, the\u00a0~*mOd oZ fAcToR*~ comes into play because of the packaging which has a sort of street art Beastie Boys theme, and I remember hearing something about a sort of art competition they hold yearly for each vintage\u2019s label. And a fascinating seminar concludes the wine fest.

We\u2019re handed our room keys as we get\u00a0off of the bus, and the front desk worker stops me as I walk through the lobby.\u00a0She specifically stops me asks\u00a0if I\u2019m Josh \u2013 I say\u00a0yes, obviously, and I wonder whether or not it\u2019s because she\u2019s secretly an undercover\u00a0agent, and that this is\u00a0the beginning of some really exciting spy film where I would discover my undiscovered penchant for leaping off buildings and using my wine knowledge to save the world. God, I need water. I know she\u2019s asking\u00a0because\u00a0there was some sort of logistical airplane\u00a0snafu with my friend Kayla (who was also a scholarship recipient last year) which led to her having to get\u00a0someone to drive her up to Geneva from Elmira. Thus,\u00a0she missed Villa Bellangelo\u00a0but\u00a0beat me to our hotel room, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how she described me to the front desk. The vaguely sober bald asian with glasses? The guy whose head looks like the inspiration behind\u00a0the Minions of\u00a0Despicable Me? We freshen up before our next winery visit; I decide my weird\u00a0lumberjack shirt should be sufficient despite the fact that I see everyone else changing into evening dresses and platform shoes. I ask Kayla but she tells me to do me, so I do me. This was beautiful but I was squinting for the entire evening. We arrive at Ventosa, receive welcoming packages, and taste two different kinds of\u00a0delicious local cider. I\u2019m\u00a0supremely fearful of dozing off at this point because I normally would, considering all this stimuli we\u2019ve received so far, but I find myself engrossed in the current theme: Finger Lakes Women. Diversity. Looking back at the conference now, I\u2019d say that this was definitely one of my favourite sessions, especially since a lack of diversity was a current criticism for both the previous year, and for the wine industry in general. They really went the full mile here, and even the\u00a0cider and provided cheese were also\u00a0crafted by women. We\u2019re reminded that Seneca Falls, just a mere 15 minutes away, was\u00a0huge for the\u00a0birth for feminism in 1848. The speakers included Marti Macinski, owner and winemaker of Standing Stone Vineyards; Jenna Lavita, winemaker at Ventosa Vineyards; Erica Paolicelli, partner at Three Brothers Winery & Estates; Liz Leidenfrost, 3rd generation owner and winemaker at Leidenfrost vineyards; and Kathleen Deys, biochemist and grape geneticist. Amazing dinner was crafted by Heather Tompkins.\u00a0Huzzah! THE STORIES! After a bit of a vineyard excursion, we went back for dinner with the panel participants. It was at this time I decided to stop taking notes and maybe swallow for once. Bad idea? Maybe. Nah. Me picking underripe grapes. After dinner, they unexpectedly open up the tasting room. It finally (?) feels like I\u2019m dying and I can hardly take a proper tasting note, and instead I\u2019m craving anything bubbly. Ventosa 2011 Lemberger (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $24\nBlack cherry, tobacco, dried herbs, lots of tomato leaf. Generous acid. Spinning head. This particular wine won the Governor\u2019s Cup for best red wine at the 2015 New York Wine & Food Classic competition, despite encouragement that Jenna Lavita shouldn\u2019t grow Lemberger, or something like that. Stony Lonesome Estate Reserve 2014 Gr\u00fcner Veltliner (Finger Lakes, New York) $14\nWhite pepper and potpourri. Dry, round, spice, green apple. Where\u2019s the water at? Standing Stone 2014 Dry Vidal (Finger Lakes, New York) $14\nThough I have tried (and liked) various Standing Stone wines throughout the conference, this is probably my least fave of theirs. Lovely white peach and orange blossom, but strangely boozy without much depth or concentration. Slight effervescence provides lift. Though\u00a0my roommate decides to be the sane one and sleep back at the hotel, some of us head to Lake Drum brewing which is just a block or two away. The beautiful space is\u00a0co-run by Jenna Lavita. What a superstar. I obviously head for the local weird shit. Give me Brett! Give me all of him! #YES Summary: darts with The Vineyard Trail and Christine; Dancing Queen; delicious beer; and raw vegetables. That is all you need to know. The next day we head to Anthony Road. Beautiful scenery, and rolling around in the grass. We\u2019re indeed greeted with a glass of ros\u00e9, we have a tour of the vineyards and winemaking facilities, and then we taste two sets of wines: an unoaked Chardonnay against one that was fermented on skins, and then a dry Riesling against one that was fermented on its skins. A traditional Geisenheim clone of Riesling on a V. riparia x V. rupestris roostock, I think. Well, according to Google. Next: Fox Run. Anthony Road 2014 Cabernet Franc Ros\u00e9 (Finger Lakes, New York) $18\nThe nose contains a hint of bubblegum among a blend of strawberry, cherry, and fresh herbs. Racy with nice red fruit intensity to balance the tart lemons. Good morning! Anthony Road 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $17\nZippy but not sharp; a hint of butter? Yellow apple, and a hint of freshly cut grass. Maybe suffers from just a hint of SO2\u00a0that\u00a0needs to blow off? Anthony Road 2014 Skin Ferment Chardonnay\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $? [unreleased]\nCompared to its naked counterpart, this version is softer on the nose, and then chewier, mellower, and rounder on the palate. Anthony Road 2014 Riesling Dry\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $18\nChalky. White flowers, most notably, with an intense spritz of elegantly fruity and gummy white peach on the palate. A bejewelled sword, or something. Anthony Road 2014 Skin Ferment Riesling\u00a0(Finger Lakes, New York) $? [unreleased]\nKind of like if the previous wine put on a hip autumn sweater. More spice and\u00a0gently oxidative autumnal fruit, or sugarless apple pie. A hint of something ashy.

For some reason I was\u00a0not tired after The Night Of No Sleep. My body knew. On a rainy morning dodging puddles and people, Christine, Amy, Leeanne, Sujinder and I bussed up to Elmira from NYC. This\u00a0of course involved\u00a0a cryptic and boisterous man who sat behind our group and modified the intensity of his New York accent depending on who he was talking to on the phone, including Joey, which included a mild conversation about picking up sodas at the dollar store; and then Beryl, to whom he aggressively told to check her mailbox and to \u201cnot worry about it\u201d (severed hand?!). Obviously the world knew our NYC experience wasn\u2019t over yet, and we\u2019ve accomplished a lot\u00a0before anything officially #WBC15. Anyways,\u00a0we then\u00a0rented a car straight up to Hammondsport, not before visiting Forge Cellars at the Hector Wine Company. So it began: this was\u00a0our first flight of wines in the sub-AVA of Seneca Lake in the Finger Lakes AVA! Though my mind was\u00a0excited like a child (or me) on his way to the ice cream store, I was physically exhausted\u00a0and maybe fell\u00a0asleep in the car in only minute-long intervals in fear that I would inadvertently create the best picture of our travels. Pictured: Sujinder judging me We\u00a0tasted through the wines of Hector Wine Company\u00a0along with\u00a0wines of\u00a0Forge Cellars, which is essentially a collaboration between Rick Rainey; Justin Boyette, winemaker at\u00a0Hector; and Louis Barruol, vigneron of Chateau Saint Combe in Gigondas, located in the Rh\u00f4ne Valley of France. And so we arrived and legs were\u00a0stretched. Hurrah. Justin Boyette Hector 2014 Pinot Gris, $18\nGreat: my first tasting note of a New York wine and I have to decipher this particular hieroglyphic tasting note. Aged in neutral French oak. A handful of white flowers and honey; savoury with a hint of herbaceousness (and a hint of something I can\u2019t read). Soft and medium-bodied. Hector 2014 Sauvignon Blanc, $18\nA bit of nettle\u00a0underlying satsuma, passionfruit, and guava. More of a supple\u00a0tropical bend rather than herbaceous and high-pitched; overcast instead\u00a0of sunny. Hector 2013 Dry Riesling, $18\nSteely and restrained nose, with lemons, honey, and peaches. Dry and not as jagged on the palate as I expected, with soothing moderate intensity. Forge 2013 \u201cClassique\u201d Riesling, $24?\nLarge proportion fermented and aged in barrels of varying ages. Something cracker or yeast-like which I\u2019ve noticed in few other Rieslings. Elegant limeade with something meaty or defiant. Focused lime zest on the palate with a pleasant bitter-acid fruit finish, like a margarita without any sugar. Forge 2013 \u201cLes Alli\u00e9s\u201d Riesling, $26\nFermented and aged in neutral barrels. Stands up straighter\u00a0than the Classique. Dry; petrol, citrus, and a hint of cooked grapefruit. A bit of oxidized tangerine on the palate with zesty acidity. Hector 2014 Riesling Semi-Dry, $16\nFresh sweeter stone fruit\u00a0on the nose; off-dry sheen\u00a0on the palate with flighty and almost effervescent peach and pit with cleansing acidity. Juicy and chuggable. Hector 2013 Gewurztraminer, $20\nA ringing\u00a0burst of spice, apricots, and dried flowers. A\u00a0hint of sweetness emerges\u00a0like a Diglett poking its head out from the ground, and this grades into a blanket of savouriness and an impressive amount of acid for the grape. Long and rosy. Forge 2013 Ros\u00e9\nPinot Noir. Pale pink. Floral strawberries and cream. Humble rather than arrogant\u00a0on the palate, with a play between fruit and earth. Concentrated. Closer to the side of round rather than refreshing. Forge 2013 \u201cLes Alli\u00e9s\u201d Pinot Noir\nVery pale ruby. Huge fan of the aromatic nose, but maybe I\u2019m just a huge fan of smoke, game, and meat. Time will disentangle the palate\u2019s rigidity. This one split our group in half, and everyone knows I love when that happens. Hector 2013 Essence, $25\nEqual parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot. Also equal parts American, French, and Hungarian oak. Slightly charred plums and chocolate; medium-bodied and silky with sparkles of ripeness. Fair amount of chalky structure to contain the fruit. Well-made but not as individualistic as the whites; muscular with a silky man bun. We left satisfied, but it was clearly time to deflate for a bit into our motel rooms. Though we snacked on two salads, evening sustenance was\u00a0a 2 minute walk away at The Village Tavern. I missed vegetables and even though I eat meat, I ordered the menu item named \u201cVegan Adventure\u201d though clearly the name was the most obvious red flag: it was basically stir fry, thin rice noodles saltier than the tears of a thousand mermaids, and a random hedged-bet garnish of pickled ginger and wasabi. Oh: is this the general \u201casian food\u201d that every wine critic promises will pair divinely with every\u00a0Gew\u00fcrztraminer? When in Rome, Josh. When in Rome! #burgerregret But really: everyone else\u2019s food was apparently amazing \u2013 and probably no one orders the Vegan Adventure to the point where they probably had to run outside immediately after my order\u00a0to go and pick the carrots out of the ground \u2013\u00a0but otherwise, the wine list was\u00a0absolutely\u00a0divine, with no shortage of interesting varieties and back vintages of New York wines and otherwise. I almost chose\u00a0a New York\u00a0Rkatsiteli from my birth year (1992) for the table but decided that it might not be refreshing enough for our temporarily ragged souls. I regret it. In lieu of dessert,\u00a0we borrowed\u00a0a knife from the restaurant so that Leeann could\u00a0teach Amy and Christine how to saber the bottles of sparkle we picked up on the way; we then we enjoyed those plus the same funky Prosecco from a previous night\u00a0and a Cr\u00e9mant de Bourgogne around the fire pit next to our living quarters, whose owner (Don? Ron? Shawn? Fawn?) joined\u00a0us as we had\u00a0conversations about the film ratings of our lives. I say that I\u2019m PG, but I mean this whole trip is changing everything, no? Regardless, this amazing evening full of vibes and connections is an ending to an episode with credits rolling and Wonderwall playing in the background. And the music abruptly stops as it cuts to a scene of next morning, where everyone is swimming\u00a0in the lake or going\u00a0for a jog or something and I obviously tangle\u00a0up in sheets instead.  Clos des Vignes du Maynes \u201cSte Genevi\u00e8ve\u201d Cr\u00e9mant de Bourgogne Extra Brut (Burgundy, France)\nNutty green apple, cider, and apple pie on the nose, with some precise acidity and doughy toast on the palate. Great by the fire and a bit of drizzle on our heads. move over, s\u2019mores", "harvested_from": "http://www.joshlikeswine.com/2015/08/26/finger-lakes-first-spits-and-fire-pits/", "count": 1, "mouth": "N/A", "eyes": "N/A", "abv": "", "nose": "N/A", "region": "", "price": "0", "variety": "N/A", "vintage": "", "sub_region": "", "producer": "N/A"}, {"name": "Josh Likes Paris", "overall": "N/A", "description": "I\u2019ve unapologetically become my parents when it comes to travelling, which primarily\u00a0means that I like to arrive at airports hours and hours before I\u00a0realistically\u00a0need to. Combine that with what Erin and I\u00a0decided to drink the night prior, which was all of Cava, fresh hop beer, and bourbon. Why?! But the morning turned out fine, and we had shitty mimosas and beer at the airport to satisfy the unending ghosts of the night prior. The short layover in Montreal slowly eased us into our French-speaking modes, followed by a decent 7-hour flight to Paris. I\u00a0sheepishly told the flight attendant that I would like the chicken option for dinner, which really just means I muttered \u201cpoulet\u201d. I don\u2019t remember what in-flight movie I saw, but after watching the trailer, I realized this might not be the time to finally watch Taken. Everyone always has one of these shitty interchangeable airplane wing pictures when they fly so here\u2019s mine. Obviously filtered the shit out of it. Earlier in the year, when we decided to do this Europe wine trip on a whim, Erin and I\u00a0had two stipulations when it came to deciding where we would travel: Bordeaux made us shrug, and Paris made our shoulders touch our earlobes. But the thought of separating Paris from our first trip to France was difficult, so\u00a0we would attempt to take silly pictures with the Eiffel Tower and maybe watch tourists spend half an hour trying to get a perfect picture\u00a0fingering the Louvre. Plus,\u00a0our Canadian friend Theran currently lived in Paris, anyways, and he\u00a0would be joining us for the bulk of the trip. So it was decided, and I took it as a sign when our first experience\u00a0on Paris\u00a0transit\u00a0involved shitty (but admittedly entertaining) rap at 10AM which was more than any of the three of us\u00a0could handle. oui As much as Paris ignited a forced montage and soundtrack (feat. Carly Rae Jepsen) of I-can\u2019t-believe-we\u2019re-actually-here realness, the first day was a jaded blur, starting with\u00a0an awkward check-in at our hostel and then settling into our triple bunk, where Erin took the very top while I claimed the bottom. This was followed by a quick visit to the Cath\u00e9dral Notre-Dame, a bit of a tour of the surrounding area, dinner at The Great Canadian Pub (yes: in retrospect, WHY?!), and wasting my travel data on Tinder. And so we slept like babies for the night. Our roommate\u00a0had\u00a0an odd combination of intentionally ripped shirts and early 2000\u2019s\u00a0cargo pants which really didn\u2019t prepare us for the gentle distracting sounds that\u00a0he provided during the night. I still think he just had a really bad itch, but Erin swears otherwise. Anyways, after some conversation (the next day, obviously), we found out that he was from Italy.\u00a0And he really liked Bounty chocolate bars. Literally don\u2019t know where this was but it was pretty soooo yeah I hate to be the guy that raves about the ~bEsT cRoIsSaNtS~ in France, but we legit had some good flaky warm ones the next morning and shared pastries\u00a0next to some body of water that flowed through the city. We\u00a0explored some streets and areas mostly to soak in vibe, and we also had\u00a0a\u00a0stupid aim of finding something to buy in Paris just so we could irritatingly\u00a0tell people that we bought it in Paris. Then we ended up at Le Tout Monde, a natural wine bar which, annoyingly, we fell in love with. At first, Google Maps told us we had arrived even though it was a dark sketchy empty intersection after crossing a bridge, though weirdly, the surrounding streets seemed much more lively after the hours we had spent at the bar. All of the amazing and weird. We attempted\u00a0to take tasting notes, but they eventually descended into haikus, and then single words, and then drunken aggressive conversations with Frenchmen. Matteo Furlani \u201cSur Lie Alpino\u201d (Vino da Tavola?, Italy)\nGrapes of Pavana, Vernaccia, Lagarino Bianco, Verderbara: I hope this is accurate, and it makes me nervous that I can\u2019t even find this last grape in the big Wine Grapes tome. Ancestral Method, if my research is correct, with no sulphites added. Hint of bruised apple and lots of white pepper and rosemary on the nose and earthy farmyard, but very open-knit and with a skein of apple skin and soil on the palate. P\u00e9tillant but quite textured. Not super long but with a ghost of minerality. Svelte and pleasantly slippery for a sparkling. Oh! Of course it\u2019s sur lie, which explains the mouthfeel. Les Vignes du Mortier 2014? \u201cBrain de Folie\u201d (Vin de France?, France)\nUnsure of the vintage one\u00a0this one, but I would bet on 2014 from research. Either Grolleau or Cab Franc (both?): my research is inconclusive because I can only find info on the red, but I swear this was a ros\u00e9. Rustic strawberries with a kick of well-woven herbaceousness (leaning towards Cab Franc but IDK you guys). Weighty and perfumed, with an echo of green pepper and strawberries on the palate. Rounded acid. More like a superlight red than a delicate ros\u00e9. Selene 2014\u00a0Beaujolais Nouveau (Beaujolais, France)\nRaspberry balsamic \u2013 lambic, even. Brett. Fresh palate, with even more evidence of something Cantillon-esque, with sprightly bits of sparkle, earth, and playful red fruit. Gentle but present structure. Ch\u00e2teau Lestignac 2014 \u201cTolrem\u201d (Vin de France, France)\nMerlot. Brett, soil, plums, dark chocolate, dried herbs. Ripe blackberries, blueberries, and lush, like a warm blanket with an odd eclectic pattern. Chalky tannins and a bit hot, but amazingly complex and strange. Mas d\u2019Agalis\u00a0\u201cYo No Puedo M\u00e1s\u00a0XIII\u201d (Vin de France, France)\nSyrah (50%), Carignan (40%), Mourv\u00e8dre (10%). Languedoc. Traditionally\u00a0not allowed to state a vintage (though Vin de France is\u00a0allowed now), hence the sneaky \u201cXIII\u201d on the label indicating 2013. Soil, blackberry skin, oregano, and meat. Ripe fruit and chalky structure. Simultaneously velvety and bumpy, and finishes tarry and ashy. This translates to something like \u201cI can\u2019t anymore\u201d, but I\u2019m pretending it means \u201cI can\u2019t even\u201d. Yannick Pelletier \u201cL\u2019Oiselet\u201d (Vin de France, France)\nLooks like past vintages have been vintage-dated, but the bottle we enjoyed seemed to be devoid of any specific year; same thing with a designation of Saint-Chinian. Hard to source down the grapes for this bottle but a faint internet grasp shows it\u2019s probably based on Grenache, Cinsaut, and Carignan. A different sort of meatiness. Tea leaves and the vague description of Asian spice. Meaty green onions and dark fruits. Kinda cool and a ripe herbaceousness but strange and almost too weird: deserves time to be enjoyed, I think, instead of us taking on so many of these cool idiosyncratic wines at once. Cushy, intoxicating, ballsy, and fiery. Yannick Pelletier \u201cl\u2019de Rien\u201d (purportedly Saint-Chinian, France, but that wouldn\u2019t make sense if it was practically all\u00a0Terret Blanc, would it?) [magnum]\nOxidized dream. Sip.\nOptic orange and nutty.\nSinks under the tongue. A tasting haiku whose matching wine identity escapes me:\n\u2013 \u201cBrown sugar and prunes.\nBitter-sweet, raspberry leaf.\nAll oceans have shores.\u201d I might not have even written this last one. All oceans have shores. Anyway, I go through this cycle of being enamoured with natural wines and then questioning the whole thing, but Le Tout Monde amongst other recent things have\u00a0certainly nudged me towards the former, fermenting\u00a0the desire\u00a0for such places back home. Pun intended, always. Cue the next morning: our mothers would kill us if we didn\u2019t take pictures with\u00a0the Eiffel tower, so we did, albeit\u00a0with a bit of a hangover. Check out this amazing cloud at this random place in Paris lol After discovering that the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es was not some sort of garden (as we had somehow convinced ourselves because we\u2019re stupid), we explored the famous street anyway and I bought my one fabulously floral Parisian shirt\u00a0about which I could shamelessly brag. Except it was from H&M, which means you could literally buy it almost anywhere in the world.\u00a0Whatever though because I bought it in Paris. We visited the whimsical Ma Cave Fleury, which mainly served\u00a0wines of the biodynamic Champagne house, Fleury, but they also served bottles of wine with similar\u00a0organic or natural philosophies\u00a0(e.g.\u00a0Puzelat-Bonhomme!). It also happened to be something like \u201cgrass days\u201d on the street, so there was astroturf everywhere, including long lawn\u00a0chairs in front of Ma Cave Fleury, where we obviously decided to sit. If we\u2019re gonna be sipping Champagne, we might as well do it on the most perfect\u00a0thrones. Flight of organic and biodynamic Champagne, including a 100% Pinot Blanc! Fleury NV Champagne Brut Nature (Champagne, France)\nA blend of the 2006 and 2007, if I remember correctly. Beautiful gold-tinged colour, with lots of lemony citrus and red apple, sea salt, brioche, and butterscotch. Dry with delicate mousse and plenty of austerity giving way to more butterscotch. Interesting nutty centre amongst the lustre. Fleury NV \u201cNotes Blanches\u201d Champagne (Champagne, France)\n100% Pinot Blanc: yes. This is the weird shit I live for. Not super aromatic, but some red apple, a bit of nuttiness, yeast, and white flowers amongst the mineral. A little abrasive and hollow on the scale of Champagne, but with an apple juice-like accessibility and\u00a0an earthy resolution. Fleury 2002 Champagne Extra Brut (Champagne, France)\nNot super extroverted and\u00a0even slightly clenched. More doughy sweetness on the palate; sugar-dusted charms with soil and mineral. Definitely a combination of nutty, fleshy, and long. Lots to play with on the palate, here. Fleury NV Champagne Ros\u00e9 de Saign\u00e9e Brut\u00a0(Champagne, France)\nDusty florals, cranberry, and earth amongst the elegant red fruit, which becomes much more explosive on the palate with more dried strawberries. Love! Erin and I obviously made the right choice splurging on Fleury before seeing Lady Gaga a few years ago. I don\u2019t remember if those apples were fake or not. We passed out for a couple of hours back at our hostel (\u201c\u20265 more minutes\u2026\u201d) before visiting the Montmartre, catching the tail-end spectacle of the Richmond Nightmarket-esque shops and the concert at the top of the hill. We were there mostly to get to Le Grand 8, a fantastic restaurant\u00a0featuring organic and natural wines, which was suggested back at Ma Cave Fleury.

It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had actively had one. More than two years ago. (Ew.) Black cherry and cola are the main stars here, and there\u2019s a subtle\u00a0dried herby undergrowth on the nose. Sage, I think.

It\u2019s a polarizing grape at which wine drinkers subconsciously learn to either smile or shudder from the mention of its name (may the odds be ever in your favour), and the subsequent hilarious discord that it produces in the wine world makes me love it even more. The grape produces wines which aren\u2019t strangers to levels of volatile acidity, which expresses itself with a pungency, sometimes in a vinegary or nail polish-y sort of way. The contradictory grape is great because it can express a cornucopia of non-fruity aromas but isn\u2019t elegant about it like top-notch Savenni\u00e8res or aged Bordeaux, and instead it Harlem Shakes its way into your nasal cavity without giving a shit about what you think. Pinotage breaks rules. I\u2019m not going to lie \u2013 I bought and opened the wine with the intention of likening it to Katniss Everdeen (the heroin to the Hunger Games trilogy, if you weren\u2019t in the loop of LIFE) and it really does make sense. The ashy earthiness is reminiscent of the coal mines of District 12 and the arena of the annual deathly sport. Pinotage usually has a demurely vibrant character that mirrors the silent and present strength of Katniss, and this particular Pinotage has a heavy-handedness that doesn\u2019t completely translate into being full-bodied and instead has a slight agile lightness and roundness.\u00a0The tannins hide a bit of character in the mouth, and despite the expected full-bodied character, there almost seems to be a bit of a hollow midpalate. Though the wine has a bit of a typical medicinal character (that I will shamelessly and obviously compare to first-aid kits that the Hunger Games contestants might use), the wine has more of a deep fruitiness and less of an overt meaty character and loud ripe pungent sweet spice that I\u2019ve seen in other examples of Pinotage \u2013 perhaps this is due to young age? This wine sort of opens up with that sort of character. I\u2019m inexperienced with Pinotage. But the high and balanced alcohol is definitely fitting for The Girl On Fire. I\u2019m currently reading the first book after seeing the first two movies in the series.

But overall, the aromas are a little less boisterous, and you can imagine the level of spice that emanates from this alcoholic bombshell. Along with spice, there are plummy farmyard aromas, dried red and black fruits, and a strong dusting of dark chocolate. A liquid black forest cake. The palate isn\u2019t exactly as viscous as you would expect for a higher-proofed wine, but the velvety juicy body is eventually shooed away by the flexed muscle tannins, and I suppose that\u2019s generally expected for an Italian red. The complex flavours are a bit more muted on the palate as a result, and something tells me this could age. So, an edit: a liquid black forest cake but with chunks of bear-shaped bark. It\u2019s sort of like those scenes in Game of Thrones (season 4 spoilers!) that revolve around The Hound, who\u2019s this big and scary (yet pretty badass) guy with half of a real face, but now and then he has these sort-of fuzzy soul scenes between either Sansa Stark or Arya Stark that either make you roll your eyes or make him more of a likeable character (or both). Which just means he\u2019s probably going to eventually die anyways. Thanks, author.  But it\u2019s pretty cool, because I hardly find any Merlot that dares to be some form of rough. The wine does find some sort of balance between tannin and fruit. If the fruit on the palate still feels slightly locked away, I can\u2019t imagine how this would taste when it was first released. It feels like there\u2019s fur growing \u00a0on the inside of my mouth. And despite 15% ABV, the wine is impressively balanced. It\u2019s macho, velvety, and rough, all in one go.

It\u2019s an understandable shame that most Merlot produced are boring ready-to-drink styles with insipid and vague red and black fruit. Only once have I come across a Merlot (that I remember, anyways) during my WSET Intermediate class that was coaxed into an aged, fruit cake-y expression with a nose full of juicy dark fruit and sweet spice \u2013 and from BC, no less \u2013 an area that can be argued to be a straight up shitty home for Merlot. I\u2019m sure we tried an aged Saint-\u00c9milion as well, but something remarkable that comes out of BC is just mind blowing. Wah wahhhh. Just kidding. This is a well done developing example of the grape, showing good concentration, structure, length, and those developing characteristics that can often be hard to find in a grape that ironically becomes the vanilla ice cream standard of wines. Dark fruits, plum, and oak share the stage with baking spice and a bit of that fruit cake quality (which smells better than it sounds), and the palate is appropriately\u00a0voluptuous\u00a0 with a med+ body \u2013 same as the Cab we had before it, but with a completely different texture. The label is cool too. Is calling it Game of Thrones-esque too much of a stretch? Among one of the first wines I tried in a restaurant was a BC Merlot (legitimately surprising) in a BC-themed flight of three.

Despite the fact that the wine is heavily dominated by Merlot compared to Cab (90/10), there\u2019s a distinct blackcurrant character that reminds me of \u2013 and maybe it\u2019s because I have beer on the mind \u2013 a vaguely similar blackcurrant note that I\u2019ve had in beer (more specifically, the Driftwood Lustrum Anniversary Sour Ale, if you cared enough to wonder). Merlot manifests itself with dark cherry and dark plum notes. Only a mere hint of oak on the nose is confirmed by the spec sheet\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the wine has only seen 20% of itself in French oak. The palate isn\u2019t as revealing, but it\u2019s starting to open up in the glass \u2013 the plummy character hides behind some earthy tannin and some woody spice. The acid isn\u2019t as high as I thought it would be which is sort of nice for an after-work unwinder, but what\u2019s impressive is the persistent and earthy finish. I\u2019d definitely love to see how this wine would develop with age. (And though half-bottles age faster than their normal counterparts due to the greater wine-to-cork (and therefore oxygen) contact, I can\u2019t say this would differ too much than the full bottle at the current moment because these particular wines have only been bottled in 2012.) Bordeaux \u2013 even in Merlot-dominated forms like this \u2013 can be pretty muscly. This wine is pretty big and mainstream like a jock, but has a plush centre.

Welcome back to the onslaught of me guessing all these blind tasted wines are from Chile, like the mother who constantly guesses your taste of the opposite gender. Ha. HA. As I said, the instructor accidentally flashed the identity of the wine on the slideshow \u2013 and then switched the order of the wines (without us knowing) to at least mix it up. The only thing I saw on the screen was \u201cMerlot\u201d (it was really \u201cCabernet Merlot\u201d \u2013 bah) so the whole time I was essentially trying to guess where this \u201cMerlot\u201d was from. Initially I thought this had to be from the New World. The texture of the wine was quite lush, and although the components that the instructor got (e.g. med+ acid, med+ tannin) pointed to a stronger structure, my original assessment had both on medium, but this could very well have been the \u201cMerlot\u201d priming. Gah. That being said, 2009 was a ripe year with good concentration. Other recent examples have shown similar patterns, and this was no exception, although I could\u2019ve sworn that the Ch\u00e2teau Potensac we had a couple of weeks ago showed higher levels of tannin. Bah. I\u2019m tired. I need more rest before these stressful bouts of\u2026 sitting down and tasting wine. Wow, okay. Could this age?

Viticulture is almost as expensive as it gets, with low yields and sloped vineyards,\u00a0leading to necessary terraces and obligatory manual harvesting. Like Condrieu to the south, plantings were relatively low as recent as the 60s and 70s but boomed in the 90s, in this case, due to Guigal and Robert Parker.

Ironically, I\u2019m pretty sure it was C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie that spurred the subsequent blends of Syrah/Shiraz and Viognier found in other wine regions, like that one time I visited Laughing Stock Vineyards in the Okanagan and tasted a wine\u00a0that was described of being in the style of C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie.

I\u2019m sure I passed but I don\u2019t think I performed in an outstanding fashion, so I should probably stop coming up with excuses to \u201ccelebrate\u201d. Oh well! I chose the wine as something that could appeal to both my brother and I \u2013 a relatively rustic and classic old world appellation that\u2019s both earthy yet suits the ripe palate of my brother, who at this point probably prefers the ripe Zinfandels of the world. I could tell within the first sips of the glass that it probably shouldn\u2019t have been my first choice, as were the vintage charts and vintage reports telling me that 2011 was only at least satisfactory if not more than a solid stamp of good for the Rh\u00f4ne. But between the three other bottles in the running (a Priorat signed by the winemaker; a 10-year-old South African Syrah; a 2009 right bank-esque Bordeaux about which I\u2019m being patient), I decided this was the appropriate one to open. The wine combines an intense stemmy earthiness on the nose with more than a handful of blackberries for pronounced character, and the palate is similar. But the ripe notes, especially in the mouth, are balanced by a whiff of twig-like earthiness. There is a fair bit of structure which is always nice for a warmer-climate wine, but it\u2019s almost obvious that some of the character needs some taming. There\u2019s also a little less of that garrigue herbal brush in any form of flavour that people often write home about with regards to Rh\u00f4ne wines. It\u2019s not bad \u2013 just wonderfully two-toned: both the entry on the nose and the finish on the palate give rise to spice and earth-dominated staidness, but the ripe black fruit fills the mid-sensation, especially on the mid-palate. This reminds me of the melancholy Stark family \u2013 and in this wine, a bit of that matriarchal warmth comes from the Grenache, but in this Syrah and Mourv\u00e8dre-supporting form of Gigondas, we see a lot of a the grounded Stark-like character, including the darker sides of Catelyn. I\u2019m surely referring to her less-than-affable nature towards Jon Snow, but there\u2019s obviously something else. Wink.

So it\u2019s clear that I didn\u2019t know as much about wine as I do now\u00a0if we recall my 20-year-old self. Let\u2019s just let that old blog post sink in. I can\u2019t find myself to delete or change it\u00a0because it\u2019s a valid thought in my wine journey: can\u2019t you see newcomers finding Saint-\u00c9milion boring? Saint-\u00c9milion is an appellation on the right bank of Bordeaux, where Merlot is king. Saint-\u00c9milion\u00a0and Pomerol are the well-known and most prestigious areas in the right bank, where Merlot arguably finds itself in its most concentrated form. As we would soon find out, Saint-\u00c9milion is the gutsier wine of the two appellations, and is\u00a0supposedly less obviously from the right bank than is Pomerol. This is easy to believe with the chalky texture, high acid, dark plum, dark berry fruit in this wine, along with the\u00a0oak that largely expresses itself with dark chocolate. There is no Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine (but there is 20% Cabernet Franc), perhaps accounting for the supremely lush and almost full body, but\u00a0despite hot alcohol and an almost-perfect finish, the wine is quite intricate and well-adjusted.\u00a0There\u2019s a bit of added robustness\u00a0from this interesting metallic earthy iron clay note in this wine which I know may put off some, but it\u2019s sewn quite well in this wine \u2013 and its apparently indicative of the region, which brought me to guess Saint-\u00c9milion. It\u2019s sort of like a furry hug in a bottle, like a friendly bear that comes up to hug you, or something like an alcoholic beard prequel to Movember that isn\u2019t a weird\u00a0hipster cocktail. Bearded\u00a0people aside, the wine has\u00a0a\u00a0cozy\u00a0gruff quality to it, which isn\u2019t surprising for a powerful vintage renowned in Bordeaux for its structure and fruit.    \u00a0", "harvested_from": "http://www.joshlikeswine.com/2014/10/29/chateau-la-serre-saint-emilion-grand-cru-2010/", "count": 1, "mouth": "dry, med+ body, high acid, med+ chalky tannin, med+ alcohol, med+ flavour intensity, earth, black fruit, blackberry, dark chocolate, mineral, oak, med+ length", "eyes": "clear, deep ruby, legs", "abv": "\u00a014.5%", "nose": "clean, youthful, med+ intensity, mineral, earth, clay, iron, black fruit, blackberry, black cherry, dark chocolate, oak, fruitcake, hint of meat", "region": "France", "price": "\u00a078", "variety": "Merlot (80%), Cabernet Franc (20%)", "vintage": "\u00a02010", "sub_region": "Saint-\u00c9milion, Bordeaux", "producer": "Ch\u00e2teau La Serre"}]}, {"name": "Mostly Pinot Noir.

That being said, this wine is a lot more earthy than I expected. The palate is light but not entirely Pinot-silky. A bit of rusticity roughens up the wine with light yet chunky tannins and a savoury back-palate. A stewed fruit character also appears. The wine does not leave the palate without a hitch, and a soft footprint of warmth is left before entirely finishing. In a blind tasting, I would definitely have guessed this as either Spanish or Italian before French.

I was really tempted to skip this week for no good reason, but I went. And I know:\u00a0rain and tiredness is no real reason not to trudge all the way to class, and yes \u2013 insert Nike commercial here or whatever \u2013 but let\u2019s not forget that I\u2019m still a pretty terrible human being. The class was business-based and we tasted two flights of four, plus an in-class analysis activity in partners. FUN! Really. \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle me at my Apothic, then you sure as hell don\u2019t deserve me at my Insignia.\u201d \u00a0 The topic my partner\u00a0and I had was \u201cCalifornia Red Blends\u201d. Just the best, sweetest, and most delicious topic. Duh. There were no hints to our flights of wine, but it became a bit evident that we were tasting\u00a0wines\u00a0whose regions we won\u2019t cover in class. Spread the love, you know? Spread it all over our mouths. The flight of whites wasn\u2019t super difficult but it had its tricks. Spritz and freshness gave the first wine away (Casal Garcia Vinho Verde, $12), while the third, the lime-dominated obvi-Riesling, had most people split between one from the Eden/Clare Valley in Australia, a drier\u00a0German Riesling (i.e. Rheingau), Alsace, or Austria. To me, it wasn\u2019t piercing enough for the first option, and not peachy and elegant enough for the next two options, and the limey more savage version\u00a0brought me to Austria (Weingut Br\u00fcndlmayer 2008 \u201cKamptaler Terrassen\u201d Riesling, $30). Could\u2019ve been a flukey guess. The fourth (Michel Torino 2013 \u201cCuma\u201d Torront\u00e9s, $14)\u00a0was easy-ish: Torront\u00e9s is part of the aromatic group of grapes that smell like Bed Bath and Beyond decided to collaborate with\u00a0the tropical section of that asian grocery store, but with more acid and generally a lighter body than grapes like Viognier and Muscat. Into it. The second wine (Dom\u00e4ne Wachau 2012 Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, $18) was the hardest of them all and had me running around in circles and I landed\u00a0a bunch of incorrect guesses like a white C\u00f4tes-du-Rhone, South African Chenin, and holy water. Ugh, Gr\u00fcner, whatever. Same diff. Though the flight of reds was harder, I don\u2019t know how I mostly nailed\u00a0the fifth (MOB 2011 D\u00e3o, $45) and sixth (Quinta Vale D. Maria 2011 Douro, $55) Portuguese wines besides the semi-hint. Spidey senses. I think the point here was that the D\u00e3o was slightly fresher than the fuller Douro field blend, though the core personalities of both were rather twin-like. But more fraternal than identical. The seventh wine (Cono Sur 2012 \u201cBlock 21 Viento Mar\u201d Pinot Noir, $20)\u00a0was a bizarre and clunky\u00a0combination of dried oranges, pomegranates, and wine gums and I wasn\u2019t super into it; the last wine (Ridge 2011 \u201cLytton Springs\u201d, $55) was fun, I suppose. It was close enough to the Portuguese wines that it had me suspicious, but it was different enough that I had to raise an eyebrow and squeeze out a half-guess before calling it a day. And then I went home and\u00a0said I wouldn\u2019t have a drink because of the next day\u2019s shindig, but I had just the smallest pinch of scotch. So yes: the\u00a0next night\u00a0included lots of alcohol and laughter and fun with awesome colleagues, plus\u00a0this bottle of\u00a0Ch\u00e2teau Coulac 1983 Saint-Croix-du-Monte. The appellation is across the river from Sauternes, and that\u2019s all I really know. Apparently a fantastic year for the region, and though there\u2019s a real honeyed character, there\u2019s a dry and almost steely nuttiness\u00a0that illuminates the amphitheatre that is\u00a0your mouth. Definitely drier than we were expecting, I think? (I was going to make a \u201cYou Sauternes me on\u201d joke, but it\u2019s the wrong appellation\u00a0and now I\u2019m sad about it.)  And then we all ran out of wine, so we had beers and whisky\u00a0instead. Drunk salad is now a thing that happens at home before I go to bed. It\u2019s true. There\u2019s a fun wine dinner happening on Sunday and I\u2019m stoked and not stoked all at the same time.

Also bought a couple more beers to try (for extending my knowledge, of course\u2026). The Samuel Smith\u2019s Raspberry Fruit Ale is apparently good (I\u2019ve only ever had the strawberry). Another colleague suggested two more beers which I shall try later. Anyways, I digress. Another colleague has once again chosen a wine for me to taste blind. Apparently it takes a while for the wine to open up, which I can understand \u2013 all I got at first were notes of basic red fruit, and vague spicy aromas of black pepper, cloves, and liquorice. Sour cherry notes are starting to appear, as well as this earthiness. I know I should let it open up more, but I can\u2019t help but want to reveal this wine soon.\u00a0It\u2019s reminiscent of this BC Pinot Noir I had recently \u2013 that earthiness is coming through. What strikes me different are the notes of sour cherry, though. I\u2019m going with either Pinot Noir, Grenache or perhaps something light like a Valpolicella. I\u2019m thinking of risking a new world guess, although it\u2019s hard to tell. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not too complex (but at the same time, it\u2019s not boring and simple) \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t price this higher than 25 dollars, and that\u2019s already a stretch. I can tell that the quality is good though. Nothing sticks out. Good structure. Aha! Revealed. The Italian classic-looking label honestly made my heart drop, because I was really settled on the Grenache thing, but at least I considered a Valpolicella. The price though \u2013 the price is almost ridiculous, I think. I\u2019m honestly not that impressed with it \u2013 but I\u2019ll give it another chance to open up.\u00a0I don\u2019t know, though \u2013 maybe it\u2019s because I recently went to a wine fair where I literally tasted around 50 Italian wines in a row. So maybe I\u2019m subconsciously and temporarily numb to them. All in all, it was okay. Nothing special, although this was balanced and solid \u2013 I\u2019ll give it that much. Edit: it turns out that a lot of people at work were really one-or-the-other about this wine. Literally half of my colleagues didn\u2019t really enjoy it while the other half really liked it. And apparently the Ripasso method thing was supposed to throw me off. I guess it kinda did.

I bought this guy months and months ago while needlessly going on a wine shopping spree at some other store. It was the last bottle they had of it (I\u2019m always a sucker for things like that), and it was somehow mentioned in Drops of God, which is a\u00a0wine-themed manga I have yet to read. I\u2019ve had this particular wine described to me as \u201cliquid clay\u201d, and I imagined this really cool fluid\u00a0earthiness that would smell like crushed Gastown bricks on fresh Commercial Drive garden soil, coming together to make\u00a0some sort of bottled East Van\u00a0(though Parallel 49 has pretty much covered that\u00a0in visual\u00a0form) \u2013 the wine obviously has more fruit than I skeptically\u00a0imagined.

Part of me wants to not care, but I really do, and I\u2019m not sure if I should hate myself in some way for falling for that kind\u00a0of marketing. It\u2019s kinda romantic. The wine is a little light\u00a0than\u00a0I expected for an opulent year, or perhaps my expectations were simply in the wrong ballpark. But if I were to compare it to a wine I\u2019ve had recently, it slightly resembles an aged Pomerol.

It\u2019s\u00a0also showing hints of development, with bits of leather showing against the mostly\u00a0baked and dried\u00a0plum-driven fruit. Subtle oak, though the back claims two years. I really like the intensity, here, and structure is also rather\u00a0subtle.\u00a0It\u2019s definitely an early-maturing style: can\u2019t develop\u00a0a better\u00a0kingdom if you don\u2019t have the walls,\u00a0so cash it in.

So my unexpected 2-day weekend was met with a half-finished blog post, nothing, Project runway, more nothing, and a decision to open this Malbec. Because I was strong enough to not drink anything yesterday (up until that pisco + orange juice experiment) and because I feel like I haven\u2019t truly relaxed for the past couple of days. Which is dangerous when that thought changes once you open a bottle of $40 wine in solitude. At first I was not impressed with the wine. Initial upfront fresh earthiness upon opening a wine always gives me paranoid thoughts of it being corked, but I let the wine open up and it delivered. On the nose, the Malbec is dominated with s spectrum of punchy fruit along with an earthiness and slight smokiness \u2013 the wine has been aged for 12 months in French oak so this is unsurprising. The peppery oakiness wraps around a prominent dark cherry, dark fruit, and slightly dried floral and raspberry character, opening up to hints of leather and dark chocolate. The deep fruit resides well with the earthy components, both being quite present. The palate is much more expressive than the nose, with vibrant and ripe fruit characteristics that echo the fruits on the palate. What\u2019s interesting to me is that we expect a mouthful of viscous syrup with the whopping 14.5% (!!!) alcohol, but the wine retains some level of finesse without loss to concentration. Structure is on the medium side, which unwinds the knots on the deep fruit flavours and silky texture. Which is exactly what you want on a night when all you\u2019re doing is wearing the same thing you were wearing 48 hours ago while having back to back Project Runway marathons. Because you can. The ripe fruit contrasts with the slight extracted-tasting bitter finish. Although this might seem like a championing excuse, I feel like this prevents the wine from being too cloying. The alcohol is well-balanced. I had to warm up to this Malbec. I was literally craving an overextracted viscous wine, but this demonstrated the difficult balance between ripe, warm-climate reds without over-sleazing the wine. I was undecided between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cvery good\u201d, but I eventually landed on the former category, though on the higher side. Tall, dark, handsome, suave, flirty, foreign.

The fuller-bodied and ripe red fruit along with the fair amount of acidity shouted New Zealand to me, and the guess of Martinborough was something I sort of partially pulled from thin air. Apparently Martinborough Pinots tend to be the most Burgundian, tending towards spice and plummy\u00a0fruit, while Marlborough is lighter and more cheery in its red fruit.

Undeniably pronounced on the palate, with intensity reflected by the high acid and fine tannins that were, for Pinot Noir, on the vociferous side.

The wine is whimsical in both theory and taste. Pinot Meunier is not a grape you typically see by itself in its lonesome blatant youthful character. In sparkling wines (e.g. Champagne), it mostly serves to contribute some form of youthful upfront fruit which isn\u2019t really meant to age for super long periods, sort of like how casual Fridays attempt to make the workweek a little less austere, or how the drunk uncle might spice up a positively boring wedding. This ros\u00e9 captures Pinot Meunier\u2019s playful, soft, and unpretentious nature, displaying melodies of mostly strawberries, rhubarb, and some floral character. A hint of spritz on the palate. Pair with Oh Land\u2019s \u201cWhite Nights\u201d, to which this wine would dance if it were a person. The wine almost veers into gummy bear territory, but the intensity of the flavours on the palate balance it out. I suppose the wine could have a bit more structure and finesse, but perhaps we would also lose its Seussian nature.

The de facto red grape, and, in the game of ice cream flavours, is essentially the bucket of quintessential vanilla. In the theme of its masculinity, it has thick skins and relatively small berries, leading to a high pip to pulp ratio and a high amount of phenolics which contributes to darker-coloured wines and high tannin, respectively. Generally resistant to rot, and planted everywhere. The poster child for red wines, really, and a great vehicle for terroir. But despite its reputation for huge wines, it tends to be on the med to med+ scale in terms of its weight. So my mind is finally at ease when I come across slightly lighter versions. And here we have a classic Australian example: typical dark fruit characteristics with hints of green (eucalyptus, mint) are the main notes, with spice in the back seat. The structure is impressive for a warm climate (acidification? If so, done well), and the concentration is good. There is a lightness or a refreshing quality despite the alcohol and body. So far, I\u2019ve seen this pattern of relative lightness and elegance (but not lacking in strength) with Margaret River wines, especially with Sandalford\u2019s Shiraz. Interestingly refreshing and almost relieving, with the trend of increasing alcohol levels of the decades both from climate change and stylistic changes. I think.

Full-bodied and viscous, and surprisingly still fresh on the palate with distinct acidity and pronounced but fine tannins. The finish was slightly clunky, where there was a hint of a funky metallic thing going on, but\u00a0overall I was quite pleased. One of my most memorable moments with Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon (well, my only perhaps) was during a weekly tasting as part of the FNH 330 (Wine Appreciation) course at UBC, years ago, where the professor had the TAs pour us a Cabernet Sauvignon. It was from Chile, purportedly, but I sent out\u00a0some e-mails and found out that the professor had blended a Chilean Cab (\u201ctoo oaky and lacking some fruit\u201d) with a Coonawarra Cab (\u201ctoo fruity and lacking some oak\u201d). Barely forgivable, in my opinion, especially after another student said he smelt eucalyptus in his wine, and then was shot down by the TA, followed by light mocking from other students:\u00a0but anyone who\u2019s familiar with Coonawarra Cab knows that eucalyptus is a benchmark aroma. I understand that the prof wanted to find a pure expression of Cab, but I think that was a contrived and ridiculous method of doing it, especially for a product that\u2019s so based in its origins. And damn, that one student had a pretty good nose. Ha. I\u2019m not sure what the point of that story was, besides to point out a story that included Coonawarra Cab and maybe an excuse to complain about random things, but I did lead a guest lecture at UBC on wine in this past week, so I\u2019ve done my\u00a0counter-duty to get students excited about wine.

So, after, instead of going home from school like a good boy, I caved in on my own desires and stopped by a different branch of the private liquor store I work at. I ended up spending a ridiculous amount of time there, and left with 6 bottles even though I planned to maybe buy 1 or 2 at the most. I bought this one in particular because the workers (co-workers, technically) at the store were all curious about it. Why not take one for the team? I don\u2019t deserve legitimate wine on a Wednesday night where I\u2019ve done no real work. This wine is laughably bad. Seriously? If your wine ends up being a pale ruby colour, why even bother keeping \u201cCabernet Sauvignon\u201d on the label? For marketing, of course, and some poor little consumer is going to buy this, thinking it\u2019s legitimate Cab Sauv, while instead, it tastes like sugar water with a red crayon dipped in it. It has long length though, if \u201clength\u201d means \u201cweird burning sensation at the back of your throat even though this is only 12.5% alcohol\u201d.

It\u2019s not bad for an alcoholic drink \u2013 it\u2019s just not proper Californian Cabernet Sauvignon. In fact, it\u2019s legitimately the opposite of Cabernet Sauvignon, and, if you served this to me blind, I would\u2019ve thought this was some Beaujolais Nouveau that would benefit from some chilling. In which case, I\u2019d be glad that I bought this anyways, because the Bojo Novo was 10 bucks more (I\u2019ve never had one\u2026). So technically this is good. I think I\u2019m going to chill this and pretend it\u2019s Beaujolais Nouveau. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there was a large proportion (if not all) of carbonic maceration. Use this shit for sangria.

Maybe I\u2019m not used to more aged examples \u2013 or just better examples in general \u2013 of the style, because the wine seemed much more full-bodied and in the darker black cherry fruit range than I expected. Sure, there was that raspberry quality all the descriptions rave about, but the fruits seemed much more stewed and evolved to me, and there was less leafiness than I expected (which I guess is a good thing), enough to convince me to propose the possibility of a C\u00f4t, which is essentially Loire Malbec.

The deep colour usually alludes to either a grape with thick skins (and/or small berry sizes) or deliberate extraction.

And because I\u2019m not hot for Chianti, I can never really give much advice in that area. I can\u2019t help it! Nah, sorry, I don\u2019t know what that Chianti is like \u2013 I\u2019ve only ever had that $17 dollar one over there one time from a tiny plastic sample cup that I had to spit out because I was working. To me, aged Chianti like this is very regal, rustic, yet very present \u2013 sort of like a Jaime Lannister sort of character. But really \u2013 it\u2019s nice having a glass of secondary characteristics. There\u2019s something about a burst of leather and wood that\u2019s simultaneously rustic and ironically refreshing. The riper and dense fruits were very nicely balanced with the non-fruits, and the finish was\u00a0relatively\u00a0long and savoury. Other guesses from the class included a Tempranillo-Garnacha blend and a Northern Rh\u00f4ne blend. Now I really want aged Chianti. For now I\u2019ll stick to other ways to get my fill of leather and wood. Okay, fine. I planned that one.

But it made sense: cherry-dominated bright red fruits, some spice, and a slight herbal note. Some deemed it a tad sour but I thought the acidity was better-integrated than other acidic wines I\u2019ve had. The problem, though: when I came back to the wine, the fruitiness was much more pronounced. I raised an eyebrow and noticed a slight confected character which I don\u2019t doubt (but at the same time, hadn\u2019t noticed too much before), but I realized that my tasting note could vaguely represent some form of Beaujolais(-Villages) with partial carbonic maceration giving way to such flavour. Plus that black pepper thing (which I think that I see more in New World Gamay). And I know that the fact that the second wine was a Chianti might have been a bit of a giveaway, but I was being optimistic, which is a weird thing for Beaujolais even though it, well, tastes optimistic. Guesses by other students included Dolcetto and Gamay. The wine itself was simple and fresh. Bright and short sour cherry with whispers of further dried herbal complexity.

Besides the 2005 Ch\u00e2teau Clerc-Milon I had earlier this year at the Vancouver Wine Fest, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve tasted legit classed Bordeaux before. The whole thing is an antiquated list that still\u00a0dictates\u00a0prices and prestige at most, so it\u2019s cool getting to try something that has that ingrained reputation. That might seem backwards for someone who studies wine, where it seems like I\u2019d want to try more esoteric and weird things, but Bordeaux is one of those regions where exports\u00a0are so crucial and centric to its spirit, that\u00a0it\u2019s interesting and equally as important to understand what the hell people are pulling their dicks out of their pants for. I have a soft spot for\u00a0Saint-Est\u00e8phe because it\u2019s the least popular of the four royal communes of the left bank in Bordeaux, with Pauillac and Margaux playing king and queen, and Saint-Julien serving as an intermediate between the two both in style and location. I\u2019ve read a wine encyclopedia describing Saint-Est\u00e8phe as the \u201cleast sexy of the M\u00e9doc\u2019s famous four communes\u201d, and I suppose the description comes from its more northerly location and therefore a slightly more uptight profile, with higher acidity and more of a graze to its texture compared to the other communes. This fourth-growth was a classic style. Brooding black fruit and dried floral flavours joined an earthy spiciness. The body\u00a0wasn\u2019t particularly heavy but still had lush texture, and\u00a0the frame\u00a0as well as the concentration exhibited a fair bit of brawn compared to the other wines in our flights.

It seems like everyone around me is getting post-holiday ailments but I\u2019m doing my best to survive. The holidays were fun but thankfully, they\u2019re never really over-the-top for me (besides last year\u2019s Soave incident). I\u00a0swatted all New Year\u2019s Eve plans out of my view in favour for cooking myself a meal, drinking a bottle of wine, and sleeping at around midnight: and you\u2019d think that would end up totally bumming\u00a0me out, but I had a satisfying sleep as the planet fully rotated into 2015, and I woke up at a decent hour to do some wine reading. I\u2019m riveting. I know. No hangover: that was a thing, though! I\u2019m not the biggest fan of New Year\u2019s resolutions, mostly because I don\u2019t plan that far ahead, and because I think it\u2019s weird to make weird and shallow decisions at some quasi-arbitrary time of the year. I tried to stop being an asshole in late August, and I mean \u2013 it didn\u2019t work, but I also didn\u2019t have to wait until January 1st, y\u2019know? Plus, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m one to remember anything I superfluously claim at the beginning of the year,\u00a0let alone most of the things I\u2019ve done in 2014. I\u2019ve looked through my calendar and journals, and holy shit: there were\u00a0way too many things I did in 2014\u00a0that I can\u2019t believe I don\u2019t remember in a quick snap. But perhaps most of my instant memory is dedicated to remembering regions of Italy, or whatever. That being said, I can\u2019t help but think about\u00a0changes to make in 2015, and I did this whole sappy review-the-year sort of bit during the eve of 2o15. And it was great, really. At the risk of sounding like a shitty Hallmark card, I\u2019m legitimately excited to see how 2015 will trump 2014. 2014 was truly a good vintage for the grapes of my soul. It\u2019s dawned on me that the diploma exam is in 6 months, which will most certainly fly by quickly. It takes dedication and time to review material and blog about it every week, so I\u2019ve decided to\u00a0condense my posts instead of squeezing each bottle of wine onto its own page. It cracks\u00a0my tepid heart in a stupid way, but hey: that\u2019s life. January is the temporary calendrical haven for the retail person, but then the wine fest will roll around in February like there was nothing to\u00a0rest on. Gotta take it chill. We come back to school this week in a class about Piemonte and Veneto. The instructors likely thought we needed a slap of acidity on the first week back just to wake us up from post-holiday doldrums, and so we did: we had two whites, the first which was a marzipan-scented Soave (Inama 2012 Soave Classico, $30) with creamy texture and intensity, appropriate to pair with a 90s slow jam; it led to the juicier and more\u00a0lightweight Gavi (Fontanafredda 2012 Gavi, $26), which was more of a bright citrus dagger with flavours of\u00a0lemon zest, apple skin, and lemon tea. We then had two flights of three: I completely blew the first flight, which were three different Valpolicellas that we had to judge in terms of quality: I thought the Amarone della Valpolicella was a Ripasso della Valpolicella; I thought the basic entry-level Valpolicella was a Dolcetto; and I thought that the last \u2013 which was the actual Ripasso della Valpolicella \u2013 was a Barbera d\u2019Asti. Great. Perhaps my palate is off because both a classmate and I took notice of an intense acidity in the Amarone (Monte del Fra 2007 \u201cLena di Mizzo\u201d Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, $80) that was apparently softer than we had perceived, though there was a lot of textbook dried fruit and chocolate character, all wrapped up in an evolved savoury and tarry leathery blanket. The basic Valpolicella (Masi 2013 \u201cBonacosta\u201d Valpolicella Classico, $17) almost seemed off, with this sort of stinky decaying leaf sort of character but in a less charming way, and subdued black fruit and a lighter body also had relatively low intensity on the palate with\u00a0tart fruit and a short finish. The actual Ripasso della Valpolicella (Musella 2011 Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso, $30) had a bit brighter acidity than I expected, with thunderous sour cherry, raspberry, and cranberry on the palate, which sounded like Barbera d\u2019Asti to me, in theory. I thought that it\u00a0needed, perhaps, slightly more concentration to balance the structure. Then again, I am just waking up. The second flight was much more straightforward, and we were told that each of the three wines were of different grapes but were from the same region: and so, deductively, it was easy to guess the Dolcetto as Dolcetto, the Barbera as Barbera, and the Nebbiolo as Nebbiolo. The first (Elio Grasso 2013 \u201cDei Grassi\u201d Dolcetto d\u2019Alba, $35) was an intense purple colour with plummy black fruit with bits of earth and an agreeable stemminess. All rather textbook on the palate with moderate acidity and chalky structure, with similar fruits on the palate and a slight lack in length. The Barbera (Ricossa 2012 Barbera D\u2019Asti, $16) even vaguely\u00a0reminded me of the wine in the previous flight that I thought was Barbera, with similar crunchy cranberry fruit and a fistful of acidity. Good value. My mouth is falling apart, at this point, and I can tell that the last wine belongs to the soul of a Nebbiolo, with aromas of forest floor, leather, dried red fruit, and wet leaves. Aromas and flavours are only beginning to shine through the thick tannic stained glass, though it\u2019s still pleasurable, and still quite young (Vietti 2012 \u201cCastiglione\u201d Barolo, $98). Next week: central Italy. The acidity continues. Lastly: what do cats drink in Piemonte? Meows-cat-o d\u2019Asti. I literally laughed out loud when I made that joke. More puns for 2015!

Originally I was supposed to put this into a flight with other traditionally-made sparklings (hence the small bottle), but I didn\u2019t drink at all yesterday, and I\u2019m thirsty. This made quite a loud pop and I\u2019m pretty sure I woke at least one person in this house at 1AM. Jesus \u2013 I\u2019m drinking Franciacorta at 1AM. I can\u2019t decide whether or not I\u2019m spoiled or desperate or a neat blend between the two. Where Cr\u00e9mant is the poor-man\u2019s Champagne, Franciacorta and Cava are the hipsters of the European traditional sparkling family. Where Cava is the thrifty Value Village-esque sparkling wine, Franciacorta is the pricier golden find from the lesser known thrift shops or trendy consignment store. Sorta. Rarely do you see Franciacorta in this market, and rarely do you find anyone that knows of it (\u201cyou probably haven\u2019t heard of it\u201d \u2013> hipster Champagne?). One time a customer came in asking for Franciacorta \u2013 perhaps simply wanting to one-up me on some knowledge \u2013 but then we ended up having a sweet conversation on wine. It was great. I left the wine outside instead of the fridge because I thought it would be warmer, but the wine is just as cold as the fridge in this current icy weather. The nose is lovely with ripe green apples, opening up to some autolytic characteristics along with some roasted and slightly salted nut tones, which is impressive for a non-vintage cuv\u00e9e (or I haven\u2019t been drinking the right ones). Balance is good, and the slightly autolytic green apple notes mirror the nose to the palate, ending with a beautifully roasted nut ending which has just a hint of bitterness.

As last week\u2019s quasi-quasi-quasi-quasi-bulk purchase of 400 flash cards (surprisingly) wasn\u2019t enough, I went ahead and bought 1000 today. Of course, no trip is complete without visits to other private liquor stores in the area (that I\u2019ve never been to) so why not? Go for flash cards, come back with wine. A mistake? Perhaps. Yes. A large proportion of my day was spent sitting at Starbucks and debating whether or not I should buy one or a combination of the following wines that I promised the sales clerk that I would return for after mulling it over: a 1990 Champagne (on clearance), a 1996 Barsac, a 2000 Barsac (same producer), a Blanquette M\u00e9thode Ancestrale (doux style), or a cold White Zinfandel (as much as I hate to admit: I was craving something like this. STOP JUDGING ME!). My ridiculous purchase of the Torres Jaime I Brandy last week (not to mention WSET Diploma tuition, for that matter) was enough to convince myself that I needed to chill out with the spending. I\u2019m waiting to crack open the brandy as a celebratory Unit 2 test results excuse \u2013 but let\u2019s be real: it\u2019s WSET, and I\u2019m probably not going to get my results for a while. Although still not the cheapest thing, I went with the Blanquette, since I\u2019ve had the dry version, and because I\u2019ve never had a \u201cdoux\u201d-designated French sparkler. Also, it\u2019s summer. The nose is interesting: dominant with ripe and juicy red apple, in contrast to the elegant greener and crunchier apple notes of Champagne, and it doesn\u2019t veer into other tree fruit notes (say, stone fruits), which a sparkler like Moscato (d\u2019Asti) can often do. Reminiscent of apple cider.\u00a0The nose also shows hints of almond and an unmistakable presence of a toasty bready character, the latter which can disappointingly be absent from more traditionally made sparklings.\u00a0The palate echoes the flavours on the nose, and almost ties in the individual elements: this tastes like apple strudel with almond flakes and hints of honey drizzle. Delicious. Varietally correct, according to Jancis, who gives the grape variety a short but concisely sweet entry in her Wine Grapes compendium. If the Loire was hipster, then sparkling Languedoc is the stuff that the stuff has never heard of. Structurally, the wine has acidity, but just enough to balance the medium-sweet character. The \u201cdoux\u201d designation means that this wine has at least 50 grams of sugar per litre, so acidity is key. More zip would have been nice, but as always, the bubbles give a bit of a textural lift. Average length. This is one of those wines that is friendly enough to please those with sweet teeth but is obscure enough to intrigue the alcohol nerds. The price tag makes me sweat a little more than I should on a hot broke-collegian summer day, but sometimes curiosity and delicious obscurity is worth it. Oh, and royal baby.

It must have been maybe back in the WSET Advanced days, which was literally over a year ago. I\u2019m only perpetuating the idea that Madeira is the biggest underdog of the wine world to the point of worry, where wine authorities wonder about its slow demise or pessimistically hope for its return in a world full of so many other things. Maybe I dreamed that it was so dramatic. But it\u2019s for poor ol\u2019 Madeira, so I\u2019ll take it. Madeira is known for being quite unique and \u201cindestructible\u201d in a sense that it\u2019s intentionally heated and oxidized. As a result, it can have a similar oxidized nuttiness like Sherry does. Unlike Sherry, though, Madeira has much more acid on the palate, which is something that I should have taken into consideration during the blind flight. Learning curve. The nose had distinct oxidized notes of almonds, cola, and soy. It\u2019s a weird combination that blends together well, and there\u2019s an interesting hint of dried citrus along with some spice and leather. As if Madeira and Sherry weren\u2019t already sort of similar, there are subsections of each which will make it even more difficult during blind flights, but then I wonder if anyone who\u2019s allergic to nuts gets a mini-heart attack every time they smell a Sherry or Madeira. This particular Madeira is made from Tinta Negra Mole, which sort of acts like a mimic to the \u201cnoble\u201d Madeira varieties, named: Sercial, Verdelho, Bual, and Malmsey. It\u2019s sort of like the pawn that reaches the end of the chess board. Because it\u2019s still damn good. This marks the first Madeira tasting of this unit. Huzzah! Picture me sticking a flag into the ground, except it\u2019s a bottle, and I\u2019m actually tossing it into a recycling bin.

Why is this the first wine in our flight? Is it to make the rest taste like water?! Unmistakably Champagne on the nose, though my classmate got excited when she said that it smelt like one of those miniature Chinese pineapple pastry things, both of us not being able to name what they were actually called. But yes: definitely a marked nutty pastry aroma combined with ripe apple aromas and just mere suggestions to more tropical ripeness, with honey and caramel to boot. The guess of vintage Champagne was a bit of a gamble. Though I need to further explore the nuances of Champagne and sparkling wine (lol), I did get a bit of an obvious nutty and oxidized sort of finish. I attributed this to age, though I supposed house style could be put into play here, if the wine was matured in oak barrels. Definitely playful, fun, classic, and a bit more mature and well-rounded from age. A bit more of a grand orchestral number compared to the second wine in our flight.

Unfortunately I don\u2019t remember the nuances of the Ca\u2019 del Bosco besides its toasty zippy goodness, mostly due to the fact that my coworkers and I were liver-deep in wine corkage, thanks to the event that was my birthday. It was a good night and I\u2019m pretty sure I went to the Biltmore afterwards followed by a drunken feast at Lucy\u2019s. There might have been some PBR somewhere during that night. So, for this WSET class, it was nice to try the traditional method Italian wine in a more sober environment. Heh. The wine was quite different from the two Champagnes in the previous flight \u2013 so different that I wasn\u2019t sure what the wine was. Fruits were slightly riper and also somewhat stretched into the stone fruit camp, though subtle. There was an interesting mineral aspect on the nose, which was slightly earthy and smoky, but almost not quite \u2013 the classmate who read out her notes detected this as a lees sort of aroma, which made sense due to the fleshy and savoury palate.\u00a0Notable is the acid, which is well-integrated and hidden behind concentration. I swore this was only medium acid, but apparently I\u2019m also an incorrect doofus. I keep making dumb analogies to Naomi Campbell and Champagne, so let\u2019s just call this one Erin O\u2019Connor because it\u2019s a much more quirky and understated traditionally-made sparkling.

I couldn\u2019t resist not going to attend this year\u2019s conference in Santa Barbara \u2013 first, California. Wine. Hi. Second, it would provide me with a fabulous answer for anyone that would ask what I was up to this summer, and I wouldn\u2019t have to come up with a fancy complicated way to say \u201cnothing\u201d. Easy sell! It was an intense whirlwind of wine, people, and vineyards. I figure that the only way to neatly communicate what I\u2019ve taken away from the conference is to do some sort of David Letterman slash Buzzfeed-esque top 10 countdown. Dreadful!

I don\u2019t travel very often.\u00a0I could, but the angel on the shoulder of my wallet says I probably shouldn\u2019t, and so I\u2019m definitely in a sea of complete unknownness when it comes to travelling alone. Thank God for fellow wine friends Valerie and Donita for being my partners during the trip. LAX was a weird Pan\u2019s Labyrinth of an airport with odd terminals and airport announcements that for some reason sounded like grumbled up horror movie ransom\u00a0audio, but fortunately we found the correct\u00a0terminal that would take us to Santa Barbara. Donita was a former travel agent, so her patience while guiding me through travel stuff on the phone \u2013 weeks before the trip \u2013 was awesome. Gold stars and hugs for you both! What sort of person doesn\u2019t say they\u2019ve been bitten by this stupid proverbial travel bug after a good trip? Come a couple weeks time, I\u2019m heading off to see more wine country. It\u2019s time for the Okanagan \u2013 I\u2019m really just making up for lost time (and drunkenness) last year. obligatory  Perhaps I\u2019m shooting myself in the foot for\u00a0even mentioning this. Greetings, potential employers! Naw, I\u2019m just not used to it. Getting my business cards in the mail evoked a slightly adult-like sensation despite my blog\u2019s dopey logo on the front. Huzzah \u2013 these were the\u00a0bits of Josh I\u2019d give out to people. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I like people, I like talking to people, I\u2019m not afraid of talking to people. But the oft-insincere\u00a0action of meeting someone for thirty seconds and then moving on to the next person for the sake of getting a business card weirds me out. It\u2019s even cringeworthy when you\u2019re seeing it happen and the people are definitely\u00a0tossing around fake giggles and smiles while they shamelessly try to shove their product down someone\u2019s\u00a0throat. But\u00a0I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just being a complete ass about the whole thing. Maybe I\u2019m repressing a hilarious memory that\u2019ll make for an embarrassing story. That sounds about right.  I\u00a0really didn\u2019t think I would get anything out of\u00a0applying for the scholarship. I went for it anyways to see what would happen \u2013 I eventually got chosen, which was awesome \u2013\u00a0like 15-minute-dance-party-at-1AM awesome. And I really really really hate to sound like I\u2019m being self-righteous here, but the fact that I was chosen perhaps means that someone on the scholarship committee\u00a0saw something in me, perhaps a thing that can be eventually moulded into something useful or cool. Something Tyra Banks would give me a sassy motivational speech about. I don\u2019t know. But I sure did feel fuzzy inside. There\u2019s really not a modest way of talking about what the scholarship means to me. I\u2019m a young wine student who works in wine retail, with a dopey blog in a wine world full of wine businesspeople and cool sommeliers. Conferences\u00a0like this, I realize (e.g. see #4) help me not only learn about wine and the regions of focus but help realize how I fit \u2013 and how I want to fit \u2013 in the industry. You can buy wine, but experience is a tough thing to get your hands on. So I\u2019m grateful for this whole experience, really. And\u00a0to that, I once again thank the sponsors for the experience and the motivation to do something great instead of sitting in my pyjamas on my laptop at 3PM. Instead, I can sit down in my pyjamas on my laptop at 3PM with a glass of wine and be motivated to write something awesome. My only regret is that I only got to meet some of you and not all of you.   Okay \u2013 so WSET Diploma tasting exams are timed, and so are tasting exams (verbally for the higher levels) for the Court of Master Sommeliers.\u00a0Enter the speed tasting event of the WBC.\u00a0Along with tasting concisely while attempting to listen to the wine reps and forming a hopefully witty tweet around a wine, there\u2019s the added challenge of not spilling anything on your laptop. I was thankfully successful, unlike that 10-dollar Cabernet Sauvignon incident of November 2012 nor the Belgian Rye IPA incident of a couple of June 2014. I think that in\u00a0those cases I definitely wasn\u2019t drinking fast enough. Or maybe I should stop placing my glasses right in front of my laptop and being a klutz. There was also a mini party in our room with 80s music playing on my laptop \u2013 it\u2019s a wonder nothing spilled on my laptop due to (my) flailing arms during anything Madonna-related.  i.e. Carl\u2019s Jr. runs at 3AM.    Sure \u2013 there\u2019s Napa, there\u2019s Sonoma. That\u2019s what people think about when the idea of Californian wine comes to mind, with matching big jammy reds and heavily oaked and creamed corn-scented Chardonnays to boot.\u00a0I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to expect when planning to march off\u00a0to Santa Barbara, but I guess that was the point \u2013 to explore a smaller and quieter region with more finessed and refreshing whites, to the grittier reds that still contained the new world spirit of California. I suppose with a smaller region and even smaller appellations (like the one my bus explored, Happy Canyon AVA), there\u2019s a really cool sense of support and camaraderie between the handfuls of wineries that are in each small region. That\u2019s definitely one thing I enjoyed.  The keynote speech of the Wine Bloggers Conference seems like the\u00a0de facto sit-down event\u00a0of the conference. I wasn\u2019t\u00a0exactly sure what to expect, and I was looking forward to it, but for some reason, sometimes listening to motivational speeches gives me the creepy crawlies.\u00a0So my ease sort of melts away during the keynote speech, and I\u2019m sitting there questioning everything while mostly everyone\u2019s eyes light up like they\u2019re being fed inspirational lightbulbs. There\u2019s the usual stuff \u2013 welcome to the conference, it\u2019s been going strong for 7 years, my name is Corbett Barr, etc. We learn how blogging is different for wine compared to other subjects that are blogged about: few earn a living compared to other subjects, the wine blogging community isn\u2019t as tight, there aren\u2019t as many industry-level bloggers, and the number of leaders are relatively few. We come to the hopeful conclusion that wine blogging isn\u2019t at its \u201cgolden age\u201d, and we address certain roadblocks and ways to overcome them. I find it difficult to identify with the bulk of these roadblocks simply because my \u201cmission\u201d is mostly\u00a0embryonic or simply nonexistent. Two years ago, my blog started off as a collection of tasting notes that veered into the direction of reviews, but eventually levelled off into a goal of nihility. My blog was \u2013 and perhaps still is \u2013 a dimly lit closet made up of one part scrapbook and one part diary, and whoever decided to peer into its dusty contents was\u00a0surely welcome. But I do it for no direct \u201cpurpose\u201d, which is perhaps why my About Me page seems like a bit of an egotistic and malformed resum\u00e9 without any sort of promise of\u00a0provision. My blog mostly just serves to be some sort of weird egotistic extension of self. So much that these solutions to addressing said \u201croadblocks\u201d feel like we\u2019re trying to find ways to\u00a0change who I am.\u00a0Which obviously wasn\u2019t the message, but\u00a0the speech evoked a big Question that\u2019ll be the next big Thing I\u2019ll have to address: do I need a more direct mission or direction? Should my blog be more like something else or less like another? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe what my life needs is a dramatic soundtrack.  One of my favourite events was the excursion out to Happy Canyon. My wine education\u00a0has mostly geared me towards being interested in the wines themselves. Click on a random blog post and there\u2019s a good chance that I\u2019ll talk about\u00a0the wine\u00a0and not the people behind it \u2013 so getting to interact with people who actually get the juice into the bottle was really cool.\u00a0James Conaway, one of the writers on the\u00a0panel of wine writers, accentuated the importance of focussing on people from a wine journalist\u2019s point of view. Come the second night, I didn\u2019t realize that my late-night crew included Jon, winemaker of Hand of God wines. I was fortunate enough to try his wines before he had to jet off early, which was unfortunate.\u00a0I also vaguely remembering all of us dancing to Get Lucky at some dive bar a couple blocks away from our respective hotels at 2AM.  A lot of people seemed to be irked by the panel of winemakers and the panel of wine writers. A lot of people made blog posts about how there wasn\u2019t enough diversity on the panels, or in the case of the wine writers, not enough diversity in their respective communicative media, wine education, gender, and so on. At the same time, this really made me smile in the slightest, because perhaps it means that there\u2019s so much more room for the global group of wine writers (and wine people in general) to grow. And I don\u2019t mean to sound like an inspirational\u00a0commercial that at one point has a picture of the earth and fancy string music, but there\u2019s so much potential for unique voices to come forward in a community that according to Corbett Barr, hasn\u2019t reached its golden age. I believe it.

I was pleasantly surprised when the new vintage wriggled its way\u00a0into my life, swimming past my doubt and into the\u00a0pleasure portions of my brain, so I definitely had to buy a bottle. But mostly because I had nothing to drink yesterday and I have\u00a0to make up for that, like now. The wine returns to its glory this vintage, with soft pear, lime, and white flowers\u00a0gliding from the glass, providing a little more intensity on the palate. There\u2019s only a minor suggestion at autolysis as the wine warms up, unfortunately, but the wine\u2019s strength lies in its balance and fruit, providing just enough acidity and lift to let the ripe fruit show through.

I don\u2019t recall ever trying one (let alone a vintage Champagne-style bubbly) so I thought I\u2019d give it a go. Basic stuff at first. Medium lemon, obvious froth upon pouring. I was disappointed in the fact that I detected little to no autolytic notes, though. All I got\u00a0on the restrained nose was some flinty green and citrus fruits. What swayed my slight disappointment were the persistent creamy bubbles, adding body to a wine that would otherwise be boring. The acid was lively, and the length was good. I\u2019d be interested to see what age would do to this wine, although I feel like it doesn\u2019t even have enough oomph to begin with \u2013 to develop. All in all, this was a wine of questionable value that was, however, a great example of that mousse-y quality that a lot of cheap bubblys don\u2019t have. The ros\u00e9 of the same producer is getting a lot of buzz at the place I\u2019m working at, so I\u2019m looking forward to snagging myself a bottle of that when I get the chance.

But yes \u2013 the whole ordeal\u00a0was partial torture because there was a huge dominance in obvious homogeneity for\u00a0heavier reds, and it becomes tough to evaluate wines when the only ones\u00a0that stick out are the ones that are \u201cdifferent\u201d. It\u2019s easy to write something off as boring when it\u2019s actually rather decent\u00a0quality, so perhaps it\u2019s safer to\u00a0treat my tasting notes as a progressive story of me gently losing my mind rather than an actual set of viable records. It\u2019s worth mentioning, though, that I highlighted some wines to retry the next day with\u00a0a clearer mind and cleaner palate, because\u00a0I felt like I needed to give some wines\u00a0a second chance \u2013 and\u00a0surprisingly\u00a0enough, most of my thoughts seemed to be the same. Huge headache at the end of the 173 wines, not to mention the beer, cider, and spirits. And I know: spitters are quitters, but whatever. I couldn\u2019t even enjoy a drink\u00a0afterwards and had to gulp\u00a0water until 1AM because I\u00a0felt like a dehydrated piece of onion\u00a0from a\u00a0package of instant noodles. Favourites and stand-outs highlighted in a fun shade of blue.      Blue Mountain NV Gold Label Brut\nAll too fresh in my mind because one of their higher tiers\u00a0was my last bottle of 2014. I subsequently fell asleep before midnight\u00a0because I am a champion.\u00a0Restrained intensity with bits of autolysis, and power.      Tantalus 2013 Riesling\nA bit more closed than I remember, but quite well-balanced. Always glad to be stabbed in the tongue by Tantalus daggers.     Thornhaven 2013 Gewurztraminer\nNot as aromatic or intense as past vintages? Maybe I\u2019m crazy. Drier style of Gew; almost full-bodied with\u00a0spice and lychee, but you already knew it would have spice and lychee because it\u2019s Gew.     Domaine de Chaberton 2013 Reserve Bacchus\nRetried this and quite liked it: lots of that floral stone fruit, persimmon, peach candies, and a weird but forgettable hint of lipstick.              Blue Mountain 2013 Pinot Gris\nThe fruit shares the limelight with the oaky nuts. Creamy and well-balanced,\u00a0like that one guy. Just\u00a0kidding. Blue Mountain 2013 Pinot Blanc\nLighter than the Pinot Gris, but with good balance between stone fruit, texture, and itty bits of oak.   Domaine de Chaberton 2013 Reserve Pinot Gris\nPeaches, flowers, green apple, and there\u2019s a bit more\u00a0concentration and verve that a lot of the Pinot Gris in this flight don\u2019t have.    Lake Breeze 2013 Pinot Blanc\nDistinctively all about the texture. Wins points for balance and texture rather than complexity. I love Lake Breeze and this is a fantastic wine, but some people masturbate to this and I kind of don\u2019t fully get it, but then again every fourth drink I order at a bar is a Bellini so   Summerhill 2013 Small Lots Pinot Gris\nThe colour of onion skin. Applesauce, hints of starburst candy, and then a floral tea finish. Into it.   Fairview Cellars 2013 Sauvignon Blanc\nAn earthy and baked tangerine character, quite reminding me of the Sauvignon Blanc-dominated 2011 Puzelat-Bonhomme Cheverny\u00a0from the Loire. I\u2019m so France-y. You already know.  Mt. Boucherie 2011 Semillon\nStunningly only okay with its reception\u00a0(???) but I thought it was an unintentional (and perhaps accidental) tribute to the style of Hunter Valley in Australia. Kind of impressed?            Poplar Grove 2011 Reserve Chardonnay\nSome complex tension on the nose. Does that make sense? Like, it\u2019s not a basic bitchardonnay. Hints on malo on the palate and balanced. Township 7 2013 Chardonnay\nA fresh playful fruit bowl. Ahhhh!  Tantalus 2013 Chardonnay\nSuch fantastic traction\u00a0between finesse and savoury character on the palate. Hints to something\u00a0buttery, but it\u2019s well contained.        Road 13 2012 Jackpot VRM\nSuperb creamy style with texture on the palate, and\u00a0there\u2019s also great tension that adds character. Quite generally well-received. Tyler Harlton 2013 By Hand White\nA bit of pear sweetness\u00a0and a hint of spritz, like the first 5 seconds of a Katy Perry music video. Also quite well-received.        Quail\u2019s Gate 2012 Pinot Noir\nLavish red fruit, strawberry; fragranced and a bit slutty.      Lake Breeze 2011 Seven Poplars Pinot Noir\nSomething pleasantly raspberry lambic-esque that\u2019s sure to please some people. Maybe I\u2019m just thirsty for beer.   Tantalus 2012 Pinot Noir\nRaspberry, black cherry, and hints of potpourri. A bit more melancholy and distraught for a Pinot. Quite intense tannins (for a Pinot) but\u00a0much more graceful and polite than the Clone 93. Tantalus 2012 Clone 93 Pinot Noir\nSpicy, merry, and a little more extroverted than its older brother. This was more popular compared to the regular. Mt. Boucherie 2012 Family Reserve Gamay Noir\nRemember that time I made out with someone in a field of\u00a0Gamay vines? I mean they weren\u2019t Mt. Boucherie vines but I really hope that those grapes make a wine that\u00a0ends up tasting something\u00a0like this. Bae/10. Oak Bay Vineyards 2012 Gamay Noir\nBlooms with intensity on the palate, and\u00a0very Beaujolais-like. Juicy and well-integrated, y\u2019all. Stoneboat 2011 Pinotage\nSomething simultaneously dusty and ripe on the nose. Some kind of dried fruit, perhaps? Fruit-driven with raspberries and vanilla; appropriately intense and interesting. I like this, but I like almost all Pinotage, riot-scented or otherwise.    Time NV The Girls Red\nSpice, red fruit, and milk chocolate to match the plummy black fruit.\u00a0Curvy and slightly hedonistic. Church & State 2010 Coyote Bowl Series Merlot\nA hint of agreeable greenness shows through the slowly-forming aged characteristics and ripe fruit.  Ex Nihilo 2010 Merlot\nShowing age but the wine isn\u2019t\u00a0super intense, and tannins are a tad\u00a0tangled. Better as it opens up.  Painted Rock 2012 Merlot\nDeep and grapey with plums and vanilla, and\u00a0a closed nose that reveals itself more on the palate. Reminds me of some modern oaked Navarra blends from Spain? Am I weird? Hester Creek 2012 Block 2 Reserve Merlot\nSmoked meat? I mean, totally bizarre\u00a0for Merlot, and it wasn\u2019t so popular with some people, but I thought it had much more balanced concentration than its barbecue sauced Cabernet Franc brother.  Poplar Grove 2010 Merlot\nSmoky fruit but restrained.\u00a0Structure cockblocks the fruit \u2013 a bit tight but pleasurable.            Alderlea Vineyards 2010 Marechal Foch Clarinet\nGood balance between fruit and earth; hints of grapiness. A bit of sweetness on the palate that I\u2019m not sure of but I suppose it\u2019s pleasant.     Osoyoos Larose 2010 Le Grand Vin\nSpicy pasta sauce and meat. Bolognese-y and clearly showing some aged characteristics at this point but still tannic as. Church & State 2009 Quintessential\nShowing well for its age, with intensity booming on the palate. Much like the previous wine with less meat flavour. Drying finish. Clos Du Soleil 2012 Celestiale\nLushly textured and early maturing. Strong backbone.     Painted Rock 2013 Red Icon\nMalbec-dom. Oaky and soft with some drying tannins on the finish.   Poplar Grove 2009 Legacy\nA bit withdrawn\u00a0on the nose but\u00a0well-structured on the palate with pleasantly evolved\u00a0characteristics. Like. Road 13 2011 Fifth Element\nRedcurrant, oak. A balanced hint of green pep.   Time 2011 Red Meritage\nHint BBQ, hint dried cherries, and a weird hint of church. So like, a church picnic, obviously.   Lake Breeze 2012 Meritage\nFirst vintage where Petit Verdot was used for this blend. Hint of meat and florals\u00a0among the balanced soft juiciness.                Church & State 2011 Coyote Bowl Series Syrah\nBlack pepper, dried flowers, party on the palate. Delicious, and definitely more of a lightly bitchy style but in like a good way.  Moon Curser 2013 Syrah\nGrapey, juicy, lush, easy, and a little slutty. But good peppery depth. Painted Rock 2012 Syrah\nGamey, meaty, and kind of smells like my spice pantry, and more specifically, the powder in those Ichiban instant noodle things? Relatively light-footed on the palate.   Poplar Grove 2011 Syrah\nBroodingly concentrated on the nose, with a bit of restrained and flexed biceps\u00a0on the finish. Good ripeness amongst the black pepper.     Elephant Island 2013 Framboise Fortified Wine\nHeady and delicious. My body is ready.  Tugwell Creek 2013 Vintage Sac\nFunky waxiness on the nose, and an interesting hint of meatiness.

I expected the latter (woo!), but chances are always to be given. And they need to be formally written down to shame certain bottles of wine. The first sniffs were an all-too-familiar estery gift box stemming from cooler fermentation temperatures. Candied pear, apple, bubble gum, and a bit of banana exploded into my nose (not literally) with a hint of an unripe greenish character. Acidity on the palate for wines like this is key, because it acts as the broom that sweeps up the food fight. That wasn\u2019t the case in this wine, and there was a bit of a slight cloy to the palate which is an ironically difficult feat considering the short length. A quick and simple, in-and-out party that no one helped clean up. Bottles of wine like this are always a bit of a boring mystery, with grapes being sourced from who-knows-where in France. This wine, literally, has gotten around. You know? I promise that I won\u2019t judge you if this is your jam, but I hope you know that you\u2019re drinking a bottle of quick and awkward sex.

The classmate to my left thought it was hilarious that I was writing a tasting note because it was that horrid, and I really thought it wouldn\u2019t be. The wine was a strange colour between pink and pale brown. The nose seemed to have faint ghostly aromas of the slightly nutty and alcoholic aftermath that were probably low-quality grapes destined for high-yielding \u201csherry\u201d production. The palate was equally as questionable with a medium-sweet sugar level, non-existent acid, and slightly more intense flavours. But from the nut water on the nose, we move on to this cocktail of stale nuts and cough syrup topped off with a couple of Halls lozenges. It\u2019s easy to hate something like this, it really is. But it\u2019s an example of a product that\u2019s cheap and easier to access for those who get drunk for the sake of it: the entire class inevitably and almost necessarily had a short political discussion, and then in slow astonishment, I realized that such a cheap and shitty product automatically destined as garbage in the wine world holds quasi-importance in other aspects. It\u2019s weird. It tastes like sad.

I\u2019ve already squealed about certain wines and their respective rockstar presenters. Eeeeee! I\u2019m legitimately looking back in my calendar to see if I did anything superexciting in the past week. I can\u2019t really think of much, but let\u2019s go through this day-by-day to see if anything fun comes up. Flashback style. I\u2019m not always a bucket full of fun, y\u2019know. Insert sparkly sounds here. Woah! Ahh. Thursday was my feeble attempt to make a wine tasting video with Chris. \u00a0I\u2019m preparing myself for a cringe-fest (as should you). So lets hope for a painless two minutes woven together from a total of forty minutes worth of maladroit footage, if it even surfaces, which I hope it doesn\u2019t. Oh \u2013 I remember that this day had an irritating combination of rain and wind to the point where umbrellas were useless, and jeans bathed in Vancouver goodness. But then I attended a beer shindig. So that was cool, and this happened:  \u2026and we all agreed. Beer of the night? (N\u00f8gne \u00d8 Sunturnbrew.)  Friday consisted of work, but then some co-workers and I visited a friend at Tapas 23, which was awesome. This was followed by a run-of-the-mill work-filled weekend. I studied a bit of Champagne on Monday \u2013 basic stuff like minimum potential alcohol, the five main areas of grape production in the famous region, grape must volume levels, and so on. The flash cards have begun. The seal has broken. Then I made a lasagna and some apple chicken as per super chill recipes. I\u2019m definitely not a natural cook, and I find myself tossing in random ingredients into dishes to see what\u2019ll happen. Also, I think I hate thyme? And I accidentally snorted dried marjoram at one point. Whatever the hell marjoram is.  I went shopping for non-slobby clothes on Tuesday before work, and I have a checked box on my calendar that says \u201cwash wine glasses\u201d because I\u2019m that boring. Also, I didn\u2019t drink anything today \u2013 is it bad that this is so exceptional that it\u2019s an actual event that I have to point out? WSET Diploma class on Wednesday was centred around the global and local market for sparkling and fortified wines (i.e. a business-centric class), taught by rockstar Master of Wine, Barbara Philip. Therefore, it becomes one of those moments where it\u2019s so amazingly horrifying reading out your tasting notes and assessment conclusions out loud: it\u2019s like grade school all over again, where you pray you won\u2019t get called on. I got called first, of course. But I did well so insert Z-snap here. It was unlike me to not drink anything after class because spitting out wines teases my liver, taste buds, and sometimes my sanity. But I think I was preparing for a birthday shindig on the Friday after having made my liver cry on Monday. But it\u2019s Thursday and I caved. How can you say no to hazelnut beer and Grimbergen? I normally could, but I woke up at noon and now it feels like 8PM.

We\u2019re virtually halfway for sessions this unit, and I feel like I haven\u2019t even studied anything yet. Today\u2019s sparkling-centric class mainly concerned the vineyard, where the main topics included grape varieties and vinification. Fun stuff. The cue cards have begun, and learning which diseases that each grape is susceptible to is sort of fun in a stupid way. We tasted a Californian blanc de noirs, a vintage Champagne, a Riesling Deutscher Sekt, a Cava with a large proportion of Chardonnay, a Cava with very little Chardonnay, and a sparkling Vouvray (this one was corked). Analyzing sparkling wine is evidently becoming a little more tricky than analyzing still wines. Differences can be super subtle, and there\u2019s so much more texture going on. You have to pay attention to the bubbles before the liquid goes flat in the glass, and the alcohol is generally always on the lower side of the spectrum \u2013 so you have to train yourself to taste the holistic difference between a sparkling wine with 12% abv, 12.5% abv, or 13% abv, because those small stair steps could reveal the difference between an Old World and New World sparkler. Hence my confusion with the first wine we tasted. Practicing is going to be so expensive. Do I have to spit out everything? Life since the last week\u2019s class has been pretty swell. There\u2019s this city-wide festival that takes place during a couple of weeks this time of year called Dine Out Vancouver (hence the accelerated amounts of sometimes-annoying food pictures on Facebook), and so a couple of friends and I went to Whet on Granville Island which was cool. I retried the latest vintage of the wine that spurred me on to \u2013 well \u2013 wine (Burrowing Owl Syrah), and I think it was still good. But my memories of such things oozed out of my head from trying my best not to giggle at our server, who endured our half-joking conversation about creating a real-life Hunger Games. And because we aren\u2019t a homogeneously alcohol-guzzling group, our improvised post-dinner plans involved us going to Chapters, where there was no shortage of us coming up with games that probably made us look suspiciously drunk, anyways. Source: http://sittingatthecrossroads.wordpress.com/ Source: http://sittingatthecrossroads.wordpress.com/ Work-filled weekend, but I did get to visit the Sardine Can, which was a quaint change from the mayhem that is Saturday night in Gastown. It almost feels like it\u2019s in a weird corner protected by a forcefield where you can watch the rest of the street, which was surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly) filled with party-goers who have the supreme ability to brace the cold in nothing but short dresses or douchey muscle shirts. I applaud you. And my glass of Rias Baixas and snack-ins made just the fanciest popcorn as I watched you trot across the street in high heels, with you attempting to avoid getting run over by that one cab. I\u2019m such an asshole.   I prepared for Tuesday. There was a big industry tasting in the early afternoon, and then I went and napped at home before heading out to the grand staff party. I got a headache somewhere in the middle of the day which prevented the shameless second and third glassfuls of Rioja and Beaujolais. Though my ridiculous idea of bringing note cards to the event with the intention of scribbling down tasting notes had failed thanks to a sad little spilled glass of beer, I do remember tasting a young Savenni\u00e8res which didn\u2019t seem very intense until you felt both the weight and the strange savoury wet wooliness that it left on your palate. Quite the wine, and quite the cheeky youth. This weekend is going to be busy, and I can\u2019t wait for yet another do-nothing Monday.

It\u2019s a bit of an in-between sparkler (that is, between the retention of fruitiness that is a typical tank method sparkling wine; and the generally more autolytic and finely moussed traditionally-made sparkling wine), but that\u2019s exactly what the transfer method results in, flavour-wise, really. That being said, this was pretty good value. There were hints of autolytic character \u2013 namely the yeasty and bread dough-like components \u2013 which melded together with the subtle aromas of ripe apple, peach, and melon. There was also a bit of buttery malolactic character which arose due to the early picking of the grapes, which retains fruity aromas but also retains a larger proportion of malic acid. The malic acid is then converted to lactic acid. Yay, science! (What if there was a Magic School Bus episode on wine, except everyone was an adult? Can someone make this?! #WSET) The wine was the same on the palate. Generally medium components with echoing flavour characteristics. The wine is ripe, bright, round, positive, and optimistic.

I had to choose between this and cheap Cava tonight, and this won. I\u2019ve been dying to retry wines that I\u2019ve had further back in my wine education (especially if it was more than a year ago) just to see whether or not my palate is consistent, and whether or not I pick up on the same notes. Obviously I knew less things about wine back then, so it\u2019s interesting to compare that disconnect. You know the crowd who likes Yellowtail? This wine almost exemplifies the extreme opposite. Whereas the Yellowtail crowd enjoys the confected and overripe fruit that the brand produces (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that!), this wine is almost devoid of any real character, hardly even exuding any minerality. The palate is the same, but displays a bit of savoury character that draws out the finish. I\u2019m mostly surprised that I\u2019ve deemed this as \u201cvery good quality\u201d in the past, even comparing it to having some ros\u00e9 Champagne similarities. And it made sense, because people loved this, and they still do. The last time I\u2019ve had this, I also called everything more intense than it was. The aromas and flavours are really hard to look for in this wine, and the strength definitely lies in the structure. The bubbles are mouth-filling (yet just a touch abrasive), the wine has a juicy + savoury minerality, and there\u2019s an evident bit of dosage the rounds out the palate even more. Otherwise \u2013 flawed bottle? Improper storage? Bottle variation? \u00a0Beautiful label, but there\u2019s really nothing there, like Karen Smith from \u201cMean Girls\u201d. It shocked me when I read that Tom Stevenson (in the new edition of the World Encyclopedia of Champagne & Sparkling Wine) rated this particular winery with a mere average of 70 points (= \u201cthe point at which any sparkling wine other than Champagne starts to become interesting\u201d), describing Lugny\u2019s wines as generally \u201cfruit driven, but all too often it is just the aroma that is fruity, and the wines lack fruit and finesse on the palate\u201d. It\u2019s disheartens me to say that I understand why he says this, but at the same time, it\u2019s an interesting example of how that might not even matter in practice. Just like how Yellowtail sold despite the cries of the wine aficionados, I would say without a doubt that this particular wine is one of the best-selling of its kind in the store. People favour its dryness, structure, and simplicity. Literally almost everyone who buys this, loves this. I\u2019m kind of scared now.

Amusingly enough, what this comparison showed was the potential for great Cr\u00e9mants to exist, something which is apparently not a common thing.

A bit of a contrast to the last wine in the flight which was the quintessential apple and pear-dominated Prosecco. This, on the other hand, had a marked mineral quality which sung more guitar arpeggios than guitar power chords. Further sniffs led me to conclude that it was undeniably very Chenin Blanc. It reminded me of a young and dry Savenni\u00e8res I had just the previous day, where the nose was all mushroom and wet wool with maybe some citrus, quince, and other pomaceous fruit in the background.

But these bubbles seemed so fantastically boring to me. The wine is made from a majority of Chardonnay, which is both shrug-worthy and perhaps shocking. The former mainly due to the clean, crisp, and neutral style \u2013 but the latter, because of the rather low proportion of traditional Cava grapes used. Codorn\u00edu and Freixenet are the two main big boy houses of Cava. But unlike Freixenet, Codorn\u00edu finds itself being a little bit more progressive, with the house pushing for the usage of the non-traditional grape. This isn\u2019t to say that Chardonnay is the unneeded foreign germ in the recipe of Cava \u2013 because I believe that it can add depth and finesse as it does in other traditionally made sparklings. I just don\u2019t think that it fits the bill in this case. At one point I stamped this as acceptable quality as did at least one other classmate of mine (who also guessed its identity as Prosecco). Perhaps it\u2019s the short nine-month period of ageing on the lees which gives it too clean of a character, but one perceptive classmate picked up on some yeastiness, where others didn\u2019t. Impressive, to say the least.

Bordeaux class, so Sauternes, unquestionably. Yeah, gurl. How often do you get to try one\u00a0of the most prized dessert wines of the world? I\u2019m not bragging, because all we get is a wee dram enough for tasting, and God knows I\u2019m poor as fuck from WSET diploma tuition, anyways. This is as close as it gets, except for that time I knocked over my boss\u2019s glass of Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Yquem. It shattered all over the floor and in perceived slow motion, I\u2019m sure. Sauternes is a dessert wine from the southern part of Bordeaux; Barsac is something of a subregion of Sauternes, and both are located near other dessert wine appellations: C\u00e9rons and Loupiac come to mind, though the actual region of Sauternes is where these dessert wines achieve the best quality.\u00a0The region, due to the conjoining rivers which surround it, achieves some form of morning mist which encourages Botrytis cinerea to thrive on the grapes, and the fungus develops into the form of noble rot rather than grey rot as the afternoon sun dries the grapes out. What blossoms, as a result,\u00a0are grapes concentrated with sugars, flavours, and acids, along with a distinct and interesting honeyed Botrytis character \u2013 one that I\u2019m still working on describing. There\u2019s something so supernatural and magnificent about harnessing rot, out of all things, to create one of the world\u2019s most expensive and natural drinks. What sets Sauternes apart from other sweet wines in a blind tasting is the liberal usage of oak, which imparts\u00a0a distinct vanilla scent.\u00a0This\u00a0wine is mainly perfumed with stone fruits,\u00a0with honeyed peach, ripe apricot,\u00a0and ripe nectarines\u00a0covered with\u00a0vanilla cream, along with baking spice, hints of earthy mushroom, and a bit of Botrytis funk.\u00a0The palate is lusciously full-bodied and mouth-coating, carrying the same flavours on the palate with more intensity. Amazing concentration, length, and complexity \u2013 though being so full-bodied and\u00a0succulent, the wine does lack some freshness and acidity on the palate. That to me says this is peaking, but for such a wine, the peaking window is still so large. Even as a first growth this is a great price.

Though this wine\u2019s aromas shy away, the structure is rounded out by the dosage and savoury character on the palate. I can understand how some people might see this wine as relatively simple, but at the same time, balance and finesse are often unappreciated. The understated yet expressive and quirky sparkle of the wine reminds me of Oh Land\u2019s \u201cWhite Nights\u201d. But not the regular version \u2013 the relaxed\u00a0Big Ugly Yellow Couch rendition. Comparatively, the price point is justified. But at face value, I\u2019d ideally pay a couple bucks less.

I\u2019m just going to go ahead arrest this train of thought and talk about this Muscat some more. The palate was luscious and full-bodied. The palate had a little more acid than I expected, especially for something Muscat-based.

It looks like Champagne is going to be a common item of delicious and academic revelry for the next couple of weeks. Unfortunately, I had to read out my tasting notes for this fella. Luckily, there weren\u2019t many corrections except for my overestimation of complexity and underestimation of length. I also underestimated quality at first, but Champagne does a thing to me. As it should. Perhaps this is a coincidental and subdued tribute to the 2014 Golden Globes, where Mo\u00ebt & Chandon has apparently been served for 23 years. I\u2019m also apparently part of the minority who even remotely gives two shits about awards shows, so I\u2019ll just stop this paragraph right here. Fuck you guys. You\u2019re not invited to my awards party. (And if you are, the password is \u201cMo\u00ebt\u201d but you have to pronounce it correctly.) But really: this Champagne was chosen to illustrate a wine with strong market presence and strength in volume, but still have, well, good quality, despite mass-market presence. Champagne is one of the immovable boulders in the wine world which can\u2019t be easily shifted. The sparkling wine market is less fragmented, especially with Champagne, and comparatively few houses control a large proportion of sales worldwide. It\u2019s a weird thing, but it\u2019s also not so weird. It\u2019s shitty yet understandable. I wouldn\u2019t give a Golden Globe to this wine, but I wouldn\u2019t kick it out of bed. It wasn\u2019t the autolytic amazingness that some Champagnes embody, but it wasn\u2019t entirely boring. Elegant notes of green apple and citrus were supported by almond tones, minerality, and subtle tones of biscuit. Letting the wine warm up slightly revealed notes of spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. And then for some reason I thought of Cinnabon. The wine is well-marketed and isn\u2019t going anywhere any time soon. It\u2019s the B-list celebrity that receives way too much attention but you for some reason don\u2019t really question it. It\u2019s kind of like Starbucks. I prefer other coffee, but I\u2019ll drink it if it\u2019s there. For me, caffeine is caffeine, kind of like Champagne is Champagne.

The lower tartaric acid speaks to the warmer climate of La Mancha, and all I can think of is how much I miss the sun. But the lowerish acid and simplicity does giving it a relaxing and nonchalant feel. It sort of embodies Monday afternoon, even though it\u2019s not the pick-me-up that you might need on such a crappy day of the week. Though I secretly love Mondays.

(This reminded me a lot of the NV Lugny Cr\u00e9mant de Bourgogne Ros\u00e9, and I thought it was at first. Hence the guess.) I may have mentioned it in a previous post, but traditionally-made sparkling ros\u00e9 is a bit of a liquid sphinx. Phenolics from red grape skins somehow cancel out the majority of toasty autolytic character (even if just a small portion of the cuv\u00e9e), and you\u2019re left with the replacement delicate red fruit notes, some of the typical pomaceous fruit, the creamy mousse, and austere structure. But combine this with the fact that producers sometimes struggle to be consistent with colour and style every year, and it almost doesn\u2019t make sense to me that top dollar goes to something so non-autolytic and relatively delicate and light like ros\u00e9 Champagne. On one point, it sort of makes sense because alternatives can really be ferocious, with the cherry and cranberry-scented ros\u00e9 Cavas that might don brutish bubbles and sometimes less balance to boot. So ros\u00e9 Champagnes do intrigue me the most (as do the people that drink them more regularly than the common peasant, like me), but then again, I guess that\u2019s where the better-valued ros\u00e9 Cr\u00e9mants come in. I suppose I\u2019m not being fair to the light and feathery still wines of the world that also command dolla billz, like the delicious Chablis and Sancerre of the world, but I do think that Chablis and Sancerre can more often be done with concentration and tacit vigour, where I\u2019ve run into some sparkling ros\u00e9s where strength only lies in the easy and quick-dissipating mousse which doesn\u2019t live for very long.\u00a0I have yet to taste a ros\u00e9 Champagne that really sweeps me off my feet with anything more than light featheriness. That being said, the instructor stated that some ros\u00e9 Cr\u00e9mants can easily be confused with that of the Champagne variety and also empathized with those who guessed this as ros\u00e9 Champagne. This was slightly more intense than the Lugny ros\u00e9, though maybe I was too harsh with the Lugny to begin with. There was a feathery finesse to the wine, and though the palate was a bit more intense than the nose, I felt like there was still a lack in focus and intensity throughout. But it grew on me slightly.

Cool. The wine was quite complex, with fully developed aromas: roasted nuts, caramel, raisin. But compared to the first wine (which was the 20-year-old tawny) I felt that there was more of a mushroom, leather, and almost rancio character that evolved on the palate to reveal a fleshy savouriness.

So I was more than excited to see its whiteness (or goldness, rather) poured into the glass, especially because I think this might be the only one in the local market. I wasn\u2019t even sure what it would taste or smell like. Citrus? Raisins? Vanilla pudding? Mangoes? Puppies? Toothpaste? Steak? It was interestingly youthful, and surprisingly not very intense, with mostly vague hints to sultana raisins, spiced notes, and baked somethings rather. There was a hint of something tropical or ripe \u2013 peach? Mango? Not particularly exuberant enough for me to really match it up. But there was a marked mineral quality which I also couldn\u2019t exactly define \u2013 but it was definitely there. Along with hints of nuts, but nothing wild. Very unique, though. The wine was essentially a flabby and unserious delight, with a syrupy body that didn\u2019t overly cloy, thank goodness. The instructor displayed this in the flight of six so that we could mentally compare this to other white fortified wines: this clearly wasn\u2019t the nutty waltz of Sherry nor was this the floral or flamboyant prance of something Muscat-based, so this filled a different niche entirely. Sweet and weird and minerally but not overly fruity.

Tavel is legitimately more interesting \u2013 because compared to other old world ros\u00e9s (or most ros\u00e9s for that matter), this ros\u00e9-only region is known for its structure and body, to which longer skin contact and higher grape ripeness can be attributed.

It\u2019s not a terribly well-known fact that a large proportion of Champagne houses buy grapes from\u00a0vineyards and produce wine, while the more elusive grower Champagne is made from grapes from which the grower themselves grew.

I underestimated both the Prosecco we had weeks ago along with this one. This is the second-ever wine I\u2019ve had from Adami and it was an example of a fantastic off-dry Prosecco. Though I prefer Adami\u2019s Extra Dry for better balance, the producer as a whole makes fantastic examples of higher-quality Prosecco. There was a bit of a discussion where it\u2019s generally accepted that Prosecco will almost never be prodigiously complex, and we find that it\u2019s almost always dominated mostly by its green apple and ripe pear fruit, complemented by the mineral tones and other fruits at its best. So at the top, where the best Prosecchi battle, we not only judge them by their small edges of complexity, but mostly \u2013 I find \u2013 by mouthfeel, balance, and concentration. And it\u2019s tough. Though it fits into a specific camp of sparkling wine, more producers are experimenting.

I\u2019ve been so lazy and partially sick \u2013 so most of my day (besides studying) consisted of watching videos on the new Super Smash Bros game and it\u2019s all I have on my mind right now.

Though there are hints of it in this wine (perhaps by the power of suggestion), I do detect the slight yeastiness of the traditional method, but the wine is mostly an gently austere frame of green apples, lemon zest, stone fruit, and this savoury ribbon of citrus zest on the finish. It\u2019s a bit easier to detect when the bubbles dissipate, but there\u2019s just a mere bit of sweetness which rounds out the high acid and adds a bit of charm. It\u2019s elegant and light-footed.

Further excited flips through the new edition of Tom Stevenson\u2019s Champagne & Sparkling Wine textbook assure me that this isn\u2019t some mistake, but rather a rare diamond in the rough of the endless bottles of what-do-I-buy expensive Champagne. I\u2019m wondering whether or not this wine will jet up in price (or has it always been this cheap? Has it always existed in this market?), or perhaps the articles of the excited wine writers will somehow reach the public and stocks will fly off the shelves only for the tears of joy in the picture to be replaced with those of the sad variety. Bad times. There are endless Champagnes (and other traditionally-made sparklings) which inherently promise autolytic and toasty characteristics from sitting on the lees, or the dead yeast cells. Apparently the breaking down of the yeast cells (autolysis) doesn\u2019t always happen regardless of winemakers that try to make it so, and this is perhaps why not all of the wines destined to be Champagne-esque end up tasting like broken promises.

I don\u2019t feel bad that it turned out to be the cheapest, but it certainly explains why these couple of young folks (couldn\u2019t be older than 25) came into the store the other day looking for a sherry that approximated this exact one. That\u2019s right \u2013 young innocent-enough-looking young\u2019uns looking for sherry \u2013 for drinking. Sherry\u2019s already one of the super-underdogs of the wine world, and it blows my mind that young people were seriously looking for one. But maybe there\u2019s a hidden hipstery market that hasn\u2019t been explored. I think I\u2019m just optimistic. This wine is apparently mainly Oloroso Sherry sweetened by the likes of Pedro Ximinez. It\u2019s weird because the two types of sherry seem quite expensive separately, and you\u2019d think that perhaps quality would maybe decrease when blended, but this isn\u2019t the case. For this one, at least. The wine had a pronounced grilled nut character, backed up by earthy notes of fig, mushroom, and a slight complex funk that all almost reminded me of an aged Cognac I once had. But if this partially reminds me of aged Cognac, then there\u2019s definitely a Sherry that\u2019s waiting to blow my mind. My mouth is ready. I\u2019m not sure why I thought it was Madeira \u2013 I think it was the unfamiliar complexity that got to me, but the lower acid makes sense here, with the Palomino grape inherently lacking such things.

I understand the general nutty appeal of other sherries, but the brine, white almond, and citrus can sometimes be a bit of an enigma to some people. So really, Palomino can be the ugly duckling that just happens to stay ugly and weird. On one hand, I understand why no one will touch Fino with a 10-foot pole (I\u2019m actually laughing because I realized this is a thing though), but I also feel like there\u2019s probably some food pairing I\u2019m missing, here. There was a discussion in class about how Fino sherry really is a food wine. And I\u2019m optimistically wondering and gazing off into the distance (complete with growling stomach), wondering if Fino can possibly be a catch-all versatile firecracker to Filipino food. Or other food I haven\u2019t considered, for that matter. I\u2019m legitimately going to test it out. Perhaps Fino will be the future hero to a young generation full of Instagram foodies. That sounds scary and exciting. You heard it here first, folks!\u00a0We\u2019re rooting for you, ugly Pal-omino!!! The wine: it was very typical Fino sherry, with white almonds, brine, mineral, citrus, and hints of pear.

This results in even more pungent fresh and briny aldehydic flavours than your typical Fino. Pasada versions like these ones occur from a bit of age (where flor dies off), but some versions can have drastically higher alcohol than this one. Cool. Onwards! Sherry has this aged and old-person blas\u00e9 sort of connotation, but there was something about this wine that was somewhere in-between \u201csummer hipster barbecue shindig\u201d and \u201csunny debonair yacht party\u201d (do you hate me yet?).

Thankfully, you can almost always get away with reporting some form of \u201cnuts\u201d with sherry \u2013 then you have to work your way from there. I guess my nose descriptor of \u201cnut dust\u201d is a bit of a stretch, but at the time it seemed appropriate though I didn\u2019t read that out loud for obvious reasons. Amontillado is essentially an aged Fino, which, from the blanched salted almond sort of baseline, gradually moves into the grilled or burnt almond sort of range. So you get a bit of a nuttier sherry than Fino without relinquishing the savoury brine characteristics. Typically dry stuff, though some Amontillado can be backsweetened with sweeter wine. Though I believe that stuff isn\u2019t allowed to be called \u201cAmontillado\u201d anymore (i.e., that Alvear Medium Dry stuff which used to be called Amontillado). This shared some characteristics to the first wine in the flight, which was a Palo Cortado \u2013 while that one had a gorgeous grilled nut nose that wrapped around a small gem of briny salt, this Amontillado seemed just as expressive but a bit louder in its Fino-esque characteristics. I remember there being much more apparent brine aromas \u2013 there were some notes of \u201colive\u201d reported by some classmates. There was also a bit more of a doughy almond pastry note along with a hint of a caramel-like aged brandy note. This was probably the most flamboyant in the sherry flight, with an awkwardly awesome sort of charm to it \u2013 very much like a jazzy number with a seemingly maladroit time signature which ends up being sort of cool. So far, I\u2019ve paired sherry with Katy Perry AND Dave Brubeck, and it makes you realize how specific yet broad the subject of sherry really is.

At first glance, there\u2019s something eerie and almost disturbing about her. I thought the books would give me more insight on Effie, but it\u2019s the other way around \u2013 they did a really good job of fleshing out her character in the films. Like Effie, Ros\u00e9 Champagne is a cryptic pink in a sea of others. Ros\u00e9 is hardly even mentioned during any levels of WSET, so Champagne versions are even more peculiar. I wonder if the dash of hue is generally viewed as more extravagant in some areas \u2013 or perhaps it\u2019s generally viewed as unserious, much like the opinion of the champenois on these particular wines. The wine had a delicate nose of mineral, flint, dried red fruits, and hints to autolysis that were generally more expressive on the palate. The acid was soprano high yet balanced, and the flavours were long-lasting. I enjoyed it, but it was almost too delicate for my tasting. The phenolics of the red grape skins in ros\u00e9 Champagnes apparently bind with molecules that contribute to autolytic character; therefore, such bready and toasty aromas are deactivated. This explains my confusion over the constant breadless traditonally-made ros\u00e9 sparklings. It all makes sense now! I\u2019m still intrigued. There\u2019s only one Effie but there are like a million more of these ros\u00e9 Champagnes.
