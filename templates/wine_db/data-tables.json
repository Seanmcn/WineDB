It’s a versatile one. This is the dark and leathery route. Chosen as a good example of this grape, the wine had a deep but balanced extraction, a long length, good structure, but lacked a bit of finesse and elegance. I underestimated both the complexity and quality, and I’m ashamed to say that at first I thought this was a Zinfandel. Lots to learn. Side-to-side comparisons help a lot. Ribera del Duero is very continental, but a high altitude can tame the hot temperatures. Large amounts of sunlight lead to better ripening while acidity is still retained due to cool nights from both continentality and altitudes. Wines from here are also of the “Tinto Fino” variety of Tempranillo – darker and more powerful than Rioja in the northeast, but from what I’ve tasted, not as powerful as the “Tinta de Toro” clone to the southwest. Great value for 30 dollars. For a grape with overwhelmingly great potential viticulturally and, well, taste-wise, it’s a shame that the majority of consumers don’t know what the hell Tempranillo is.

As if “earthy” and “mineral” weren’t strange enough to describe to people, we arrive at a wine that’s so weird – yet so classic – that it’s bound to split people in the middle like the burning tire and ash-scented South African Pinotage. Savennières is an appellation from the Loire Valley in France that produces dry, concentrated, and fundamentally non-fruity wines from Chenin Blanc, and Baumard makes exceptional and superlative examples described by Jancis Robinson as “a wine for intellectuals, not neophytes.” That’s the most shade I’ve ever seen anyone throw from within an encyclopedia. It’s one of those wines that’s hard to put into words: so much, that it almost sounds disgusting on paper, but experiencing the wine – without sounding too ridiculous about it – really is sort of otherworldly. Not in a superficial spiritual sense, but in a way where you’re questioning how the fuck a wine could smell and taste like cream of mushroom soup. I understand the wasabi note that manifests itself from the mineral, wet wool, and savoury notes you typically get from dry Loire Chenin Blanc. It’s just much more concentrated here, with fruit playing second or even third fiddle, the nose posing much more wet wool in its place, and to a lesser extent, cream of mushroom and slightly oxidative scents. It’s a wine that’s apparently undrinkable in its youth and takes years and years for it to even blossom, and I believe it, but I wonder how much faith and time it took to figure out the secrets of dry aged Chenin. It’s like the Feebas-Milotic of wine, and if you understood that, that’s all you really need to know. The palate is full-bodied, but the wine isn’t as high in acid as I expected for a Savennières that’s relatively early in its journey. The alcohol is a bit evident on the finish, but can be forgiven with the lush and developing flavours of cream, mushroom, and mineral on the palate. The wine’s center is quite savoury and it ends slightly bitter and floral, but they intertwine with the hints of mushroom and mineral flavours well onto a long finish. During some research, I now understand the common tasting note of there being some lack of uplift. Andrew Jefford describes this particular wine as one that “[rivals] Corton-Charlemagne and Montrachet; dense, glycerous and flavor saturated packed with honey nuts and flowers.” I can’t say whether or not this is an exaggeration because I haven’t had my fair shares of Corton-Charlemagne or Montrachet (you can’t spell Montrachet without ratchet! *slow clap*), but I can say with certainty that this is pretty damn good for half or a third of the price of the purported Burgundian counterparts.

A similar palate, with just the slightest itty bit of salted almond. I can’t help but compare dry Madeira to Sherry, since they’re essentially cousins on some level. This was definitely brighter than many if not all Sherries, and definitely none of the signature acetaldehyde characteristics – instead, there was more of a typical cooked citrus and a little more dried fruit.

And my first thought was not “is my wallet still in my jacket?!”, but was more along the lines of “are my Bordeaux notes still in my jacket pocket and are they dry?!” and the headrush as I got up from the couch to check was not a good one, but all was good in the world, almost fantastic enough to make me sing praises to god and then make an irritating Tumblr picture out of it. And then I went out for Dim Sum with family because it was Family Day. Cinq à Sept on Tuesday at the Abbey. It was great, considering that the last one involved forever Gin and amaro. This time it was tame but with the busyness and crowded qualities of a swimming pool’s locker room during a hot summer day. Sometimes, “networking” is a word I hate a little more than “moist”. So thanks, alcohol. Why hasn’t Sia written a song about my life yet? After, a friend and I escaped to drink more wine and eat dinner at Merchants. And we stole another friend to join us over Nahe Riesling and weird manure-esque Salice Salentino. And sour beer things. That’s all I mostly remember, and that’s definitely not a good sign? Not pictured: sobriety Bottle share the next day. This included Sauternes (thus enabling the use of a stupid “You Sauternes me on” joke) and a vertical of Driftwood’s Cellar Dweller among other cool things. Untappd booster pack, basically. And my beer cellar grows faster than I consume its contents, so any excuse to bring beer to a thing is a good one?  Taylor on Thursday. And so what happened was accidental 90s night. I *just* missed the whole pogs thing while growing up, being part of the tail-end of the 90s kids generation, but I’m surprisingly decent at a game that requires aim even in the slightest because I’m literally the opposite of Katniss. Kerplunk was a thing (I don’t understand why I think you’re interested in hearing about the board games I’ve played in the past few weeks), and I haven’t played it since elementary school, where it was hardly played anyways because everyone stole the marbles. Also not in the cards: me being an architect. In the cards: me drinking cheap wine and still enjoying it.  I wish I had lots to say about the German wines we tried in class, but a cold has graced my cranium and I can’t smell shit.

It’s not a terribly well-known fact that a large proportion of Champagne houses buy grapes from vineyards and produce wine, while the more elusive grower Champagne is made from grapes from which the grower themselves grew. This latter style of Champagne alludes to a more representative wine of the vineyards (but this doesn’t necessarily mean quality). This wine was a fantastic grower Champagne that was chosen in our flight to contrast with a much more mass-produced bottle. This was much more autolysis-driven, with aromas that combined to form a sort of buttered pastry sort of smell. Breakfast in a glass? Good morning. This wine was much rounder than the first, being slightly heavier in body and alcohol, along with a slightly lower acidity. The subtle ripeness of this wine led some of the class to meander a guess of a traditionally-made New World version, myself included – but it just so happens that this was a Champagne where the acidity didn’t create a river of saliva in your mouth.

But overall, the aromas are a little less boisterous, and you can imagine the level of spice that emanates from this alcoholic bombshell. Along with spice, there are plummy farmyard aromas, dried red and black fruits, and a strong dusting of dark chocolate. A liquid black forest cake. The palate isn’t exactly as viscous as you would expect for a higher-proofed wine, but the velvety juicy body is eventually shooed away by the flexed muscle tannins, and I suppose that’s generally expected for an Italian red. The complex flavours are a bit more muted on the palate as a result, and something tells me this could age. So, an edit: a liquid black forest cake but with chunks of bear-shaped bark. It’s sort of like those scenes in Game of Thrones (season 4 spoilers!) that revolve around The Hound, who’s this big and scary (yet pretty badass) guy with half of a real face, but now and then he has these sort-of fuzzy soul scenes between either Sansa Stark or Arya Stark that either make you roll your eyes or make him more of a likeable character (or both). Which just means he’s probably going to eventually die anyways. Thanks, author.  But it’s pretty cool, because I hardly find any Merlot that dares to be some form of rough.

I mean, it’s nice to hang out with friends, eat candy, carve pumpkins, and eat pumpkin-flavoured things, but seeing drunk-ass half-dressed teenagers à la Mean Girls gets tiring, annoying, and mind-grating, and all I want to do on Halloween is lock myself in my room and do homework. Of course that all changes when you go on Facebook seeing everyone have fun but you, and you wish you weren’t such a bitter old man stuck in a college-boy’s body. I’m glad it’s raining this weekend. ALL YOUR FACE PAINT IS MELTING OFF. Of course, I’m working on actual Halloween. I’m going to see if work will let me wear bloody things and carry around a bloody prop-hammer-axe-not-really-a-prop. So I thought I’d have my co-workers blind me with a wine after having been inspired by the amazing WineAlign blind tasting competition videos as well has not having done it in a while. Geez – it’s such a seemingly pretentious and obscure talent, but being able to identify a wine by smell and taste is so cool. It’s also something I love about wine – the fact that it’s a liquid expression of where it’s from; a drinkable gustatory and olfactory stamp of an area, whether that be climate, grape, terroir, or particular winemaking. It’s like taking a picture with a camera that records aromas and flavours. This wine in particular was quite Old World in style. Minerality was quite evident on the nose, and funnily enough, I first noticed a nuance of stone fruit. I let the wine warm up a bit to release some aromas, which were more citrus and grassy – but not pungent in that New World style. I really did enjoy the nose more than the palate. The palate was an explosion of tart lemons and mineral, and the acidity was med to med+ at most, the length was average if not below, and the alcohol was a little bit hot and disjointed which was weird considering the alcohol content (12% ABV). The mineral characteristics screamed Old World, the supposed hot alcohol brought me to the south, and the Sauvignon characteristics brought me to something of a white Bordeaux (Gascogne – close enough),  but I recall having a fleeting thought of Albariño or Macabeo before I put it in my mouth. Quite young so the vintage was a no-brainer (2010), and I guessed a wine around 20 dollars. Needless to say, I beamed when I guessed the wine correctly. It’s slightly easier because we’re all familiar with the wines in the store. Gros Manseng is a bit obscure though. Can’t say I or many of my colleagues or wine geek friends have ever had any if not one, ever. The citrus in this wine pops so much that it’s almost a replacement for squeezing lemon over your food (or matching it with food that has lemon). I can’t help but think that this would go well with seafood, or in particular, a Filipino dish called “pancit” – it would be a cool calamansi/lemon replacement, and this wine gave me that tart kick (I’m probably just excited because pairing Filipino food with wine is so tough – stay tuned for an article).

The relatively high acid is well-eclipsed and there is a mere suggestion of tannin. There’s a fantastic give-and-take with the fruit and earth components, especially on the palate. I feel that Tavel is a super underrated region despite its relatively well-known name – but as summer approaches, crowds of people begin to crave high quality examples from both sides of the spectrum.

Girl, don’t even. Although easy to grow, Chardonnay buds early, which means that this is probably why the Germans don’t focus on a regional expression, and yet another reason why Champagne is pricey. Chardonnay isn’t entirely disease-resistant either, and can be susceptible to powdery mildew, grapevine yellows, coulure, millerandage, and rot. A long list, but the amount of Chardonnay grown speaks for itself. This was a very good representation of Chardonnay – typical ripe green fruit notes dominated by the savoury butter, spice, and kernel flavours, with a heavier body, modest acid, and oak on the palate. Buttery smoothness despite the higher-than-expected acid, which is nice.

Oz Clarke lists Bodegas Borsao’s other Garnacha as a recommended wine to try (which is 5 dollars cheaper than this one), so now I’m curious. The wine itself was delicious. Fruity, and a bit more residual sugar despite being dry: my tongue finally has something to play around with and analyze something here.

I adore how Oz Clarke describes the grape as wanting to “please everybody”, such that it dolls itself up: it’s voluptuous, perfumed, and heady. At times, it reminds me of either the quirky and suave fellow or the aunt who seems to only appear at those family gatherings and you know she’s just there because you can smell the perfume from miles away. That’s the classic Alsatian expression, of course, and there exist some leaner examples which are delicious but are almost disappointing when all you want are, according to Oz Clarke, “clouds of Yves Saint Laurent’s Opium, Calvin Klein’s Obsession and Giorgio of Beverley Hills to billow out before you, announcing the arrival of the one grape no one can resist.” To top it all off, the grapes are often a dark pinkish lavender smoky-eye colour that, perhaps, you’d never guess would make white wine. Thusly you’d think that it would be so gettable, like that noxious aunt – and it often is – but it can be confused with grapes like Muscat, Viognier, and at times, Torrontes. Gewurztraminer is a grape that’s naturally quite low in acidity so it’s a bit of a giveaway like in this wine, where the low acid comes out in the pillowy texture. Low acid is tough because it often disrobes the wine to reveal any trace of residual sugar, but this wine was still noticeably dry. That being said, apparently I’m not allowed to bully Gewurztraminer in my WSET quality assessment for having flabby structure since that’s what it’s normally like. Born This Way by Lady Gaga, or something.

I had to choose between this and cheap Cava tonight, and this won. I’ve been dying to retry wines that I’ve had further back in my wine education (especially if it was more than a year ago) just to see whether or not my palate is consistent, and whether or not I pick up on the same notes. Obviously I knew less things about wine back then, so it’s interesting to compare that disconnect. You know the crowd who likes Yellowtail? This wine almost exemplifies the extreme opposite. Whereas the Yellowtail crowd enjoys the confected and overripe fruit that the brand produces (not that there’s anything wrong with that!), this wine is almost devoid of any real character, hardly even exuding any minerality. The palate is the same, but displays a bit of savoury character that draws out the finish. I’m mostly surprised that I’ve deemed this as “very good quality” in the past, even comparing it to having some rosé Champagne similarities. And it made sense, because people loved this, and they still do. The last time I’ve had this, I also called everything more intense than it was. The aromas and flavours are really hard to look for in this wine, and the strength definitely lies in the structure. The bubbles are mouth-filling (yet just a touch abrasive), the wine has a juicy + savoury minerality, and there’s an evident bit of dosage the rounds out the palate even more. Otherwise – flawed bottle? Improper storage? Bottle variation?  Beautiful label, but there’s really nothing there, like Karen Smith from “Mean Girls”. It shocked me when I read that Tom Stevenson (in the new edition of the World Encyclopedia of Champagne & Sparkling Wine) rated this particular winery with a mere average of 70 points (= “the point at which any sparkling wine other than Champagne starts to become interesting”), describing Lugny’s wines as generally “fruit driven, but all too often it is just the aroma that is fruity, and the wines lack fruit and finesse on the palate”. It’s disheartens me to say that I understand why he says this, but at the same time, it’s an interesting example of how that might not even matter in practice. Just like how Yellowtail sold despite the cries of the wine aficionados, I would say without a doubt that this particular wine is one of the best-selling of its kind in the store.

I’m feeling mighty uninspired. I think it might have to do with the clouds and rain, which are normally quite nice, but something’s blocking my brain and I feel like I have to obligatorily blame it on the weather.

It sure is an excuse to get juices flowing with actual alcoholic juice, but I’m going to not because my brain is telling me no. (Which means it’s going to be one can of beer or just a hint of scotch. And then maybe more scotch.) wow can u not Two weeks ago, I skipped class on southern Italy to attend an afternoon whisky seminar followed by a sobering nap. And then downtown for a good friend’s birthday. Would’ve been great had I not had to work early the next day, but I guess these things make you feel alive, even if “alive” means “searing headache”. Last week, I skipped a workshop class in order to study, sip on some Franciacorta, and hang out with some cool people. I was really tempted to skip this week for no good reason, but I went. And I know: rain and tiredness is no real reason not to trudge all the way to class, and yes – insert Nike commercial here or whatever – but let’s not forget that I’m still a pretty terrible human being. The class was business-based and we tasted two flights of four, plus an in-class analysis activity in partners. FUN! Really. “If you can’t handle me at my Apothic, then you sure as hell don’t deserve me at my Insignia.”   The topic my partner and I had was “California Red Blends”. Just the best, sweetest, and most delicious topic. Duh. There were no hints to our flights of wine, but it became a bit evident that we were tasting wines whose regions we won’t cover in class. Spread the love, you know? Spread it all over our mouths. The flight of whites wasn’t super difficult but it had its tricks. Spritz and freshness gave the first wine away (Casal Garcia Vinho Verde, $12), while the third, the lime-dominated obvi-Riesling, had most people split between one from the Eden/Clare Valley in Australia, a drier German Riesling (i.e. Rheingau), Alsace, or Austria. To me, it wasn’t piercing enough for the first option, and not peachy and elegant enough for the next two options, and the limey more savage version brought me to Austria (Weingut Bründlmayer 2008 “Kamptaler Terrassen” Riesling, $30). Could’ve been a flukey guess. The fourth (Michel Torino 2013 “Cuma” Torrontés, $14) was easy-ish: Torrontés is part of the aromatic group of grapes that smell like Bed Bath and Beyond decided to collaborate with the tropical section of that asian grocery store, but with more acid and generally a lighter body than grapes like Viognier and Muscat. Into it. The second wine (Domäne Wachau 2012 Grüner Veltliner, $18) was the hardest of them all and had me running around in circles and I landed a bunch of incorrect guesses like a white Côtes-du-Rhone, South African Chenin, and holy water. Ugh, Grüner, whatever. Same diff. Though the flight of reds was harder, I don’t know how I mostly nailed the fifth (MOB 2011 Dão, $45) and sixth (Quinta Vale D. Maria 2011 Douro, $55) Portuguese wines besides the semi-hint. Spidey senses. I think the point here was that the Dão was slightly fresher than the fuller Douro field blend, though the core personalities of both were rather twin-like. But more fraternal than identical. The seventh wine (Cono Sur 2012 “Block 21 Viento Mar” Pinot Noir, $20) was a bizarre and clunky combination of dried oranges, pomegranates, and wine gums and I wasn’t super into it; the last wine (Ridge 2011 “Lytton Springs”, $55) was fun, I suppose. It was close enough to the Portuguese wines that it had me suspicious, but it was different enough that I had to raise an eyebrow and squeeze out a half-guess before calling it a day. And then I went home and said I wouldn’t have a drink because of the next day’s shindig, but I had just the smallest pinch of scotch. So yes: the next night included lots of alcohol and laughter and fun with awesome colleagues, plus this bottle of Château Coulac 1983 Saint-Croix-du-Monte. The appellation is across the river from Sauternes, and that’s all I really know. Apparently a fantastic year for the region, and though there’s a real honeyed character, there’s a dry and almost steely nuttiness that illuminates the amphitheatre that is your mouth. Definitely drier than we were expecting, I think? (I was going to make a “You Sauternes me on” joke, but it’s the wrong appellation and now I’m sad about it.)  And then we all ran out of wine, so we had beers and whisky instead. Drunk salad is now a thing that happens at home before I go to bed. It’s true.

I’ve dabbled with a bit of Gros Manseng in the past, but the underdog wines of Southwest France intrigue me. They’re understated hipster twin grapes. Hello, Mary-Kate and Ashley! 2012 went down in history for the setting of catastrophically low (yet not necessarily low quality) yields in Europe, resulting in drastically lower exports in some areas, and lower quality in regions where viticulturists and winemakers played the parts of absent parents. So buying a pricier bottle of wine branded with a scarlet letter was already a risk, but curiosity made the cat drunk. So here we are, and I’m so glad you can’t see all the typos, spilled wine, and teardrops from back-to-back proposal videos and Project Runway. Both grapes in the mix are intrinsically intensely flavoured. But Gros Manseng is the much more vigorous grape of the two (let’s call this one Ashley), while Petit Manseng has smaller berries at lower yields, resulting in slightly intenser flavours of the latter grape (let’s call this one Mary-Kate). Both grapes need care in the winery due to thick skins (hence higher levels of polyphenols and tannins), but both grapes naturally contain a high amount of acid, easily enabling winemakers to let them ripen on the vine. This can lead to better levels of phenolic ripeness and the possible option of late-harvest sweet treats. These grapes are surprisingly easier growers, which means that my stupid Olsen twin analogy isn’t completely nothing. Yay! Full House, y’all. I’m a bit of a basket case when it comes to detecting oak (and TCA for that matter), but this time I’ve guessed correctly (!), with the wine having seen 6 months of fermentation and age in oak. The nose is quite intriguing with a spicy apricot sort of deal, along with a hint of vague melon. The palate shows similar flavours, but the fruit is overtaken by a wave of refreshing minerality, leaving behind a sand bed of savoury spice. The wine doesn’t hide its alcohol content very well, but it retains some level of finesse and freshness despite the expected fullness. The palate has acid, but it’s not the mouth-filling tartaric acid: a tart front-filling malic acid character adds a tangy sour candy sort of feel. The direct stone fruit character, minerality, and headiness are reminiscent of Alsatian Pinot Gris, but the bit of oak and acidity are different enough to leave a different sort of footprint.

The rating – or overall comment, rather – on this wine, is that it’s “extraordinarily exceptional”, which equates to the author’s prestigious 2-star stamping. But these bubbles seemed so fantastically boring to me. The wine is made from a majority of Chardonnay, which is both shrug-worthy and perhaps shocking. The former mainly due to the clean, crisp, and neutral style – but the latter, because of the rather low proportion of traditional Cava grapes used. Codorníu and Freixenet are the two main big boy houses of Cava. But unlike Freixenet, Codorníu finds itself being a little bit more progressive, with the house pushing for the usage of the non-traditional grape. This isn’t to say that Chardonnay is the unneeded foreign germ in the recipe of Cava – because I believe that it can add depth and finesse as it does in other traditionally made sparklings. I just don’t think that it fits the bill in this case. At one point I stamped this as acceptable quality as did at least one other classmate of mine (who also guessed its identity as Prosecco). Perhaps it’s the short nine-month period of ageing on the lees which gives it too clean of a character, but one perceptive classmate picked up on some yeastiness, where others didn’t.

I’m a sucker for anything(/wine) that has underdog status, so a pretty label claiming a traditional method sparkling from Argentina is definitely up that alley. Plus, I thought it would be a nice Peeta Mellark addition to the Katniss Everdeen wine I just reviewed. Huzzah? It fits. The wine has a surprising amount of legit autolytic character. It’s a bit more elegant on the nose, and I swear my red-apple-nose and green-apple-palate thing isn’t just a snobbish-sounding differentiation: the nose definitely has a more subtle but ripe apple brioche thing going on, but the palate has an slightly exuberant acidity that zips the colour out of the red apple and more into the green. It finishes with a bit of a citrus zest curtsy, and there is a gentle lacing of autolytic character and slight nuttiness throughout the palate. And I really hope I’m not just pigeon-holing my wines into character slots, here, because it actually really fits – Peeta Mellark is the baker’s boy from District 12 in the Hunger Games series, and we eventually learn that he’s sort of this artistic but slightly romantic and physically clumsy treat. And it sort of works here, if you make connections to the elegant aromas, the autolytic/bready nose, and the contrasting slightly clunky palate. This is a couple bucks more than some Crémants and some other traditionally-made sparklings. Although it’s slightly less elegant that some I’ve tried, it’s also easily toastier. Though I’ve learned to love my Champagne, I’d easily skip them for the frugal New Year’s Eve and go for this. If this is even on the frugal side. Maybe not.

Hmm?) to something a little more plain and bold in a weird way. There’s something about the bottles that tell me what they’re like on the front side – that turn me off, but it’s not a bad marketing technique for the lower-priced bottles. Also, they misspelled “floral” and it says “florat”. Mmm, Florat tones! I’ve never had a Malvasia outside of Madeira. From what I know, it’s low in acidity and has floral and stone fruit aromas in its still form, so it understandably blends well with Moscato. This wine gains points for typicity: I smell canned stone fruits with a bit of a tropical kick and some flowers, but two colleagues agreed that the wine was drier – and even less fruity – than we expected. The palate definitely lacks more than a bit of depth. The wine seems almost watery, and the lower acid of both grapes is evident, making it a “smooth” wine, so I guess the label wasn’t entirely lying.

I instantly guessed a hot climate new world wine, although I pegged Australia on the third guess. This wine had a lot of body to it – a really weighty and thick character. I guessed a Chardonnay, which my colleague understood, but was wrong. Another analysis of the floral nose had me guessing Viognier in no time (majority of the blend) (and later I was all – “well duh, of COURSE this is Viognier, how could I be so stupid?”),  but it was the other grape took me a while to guess. I’m not amazingly familiar with Marsanne, but I think it was this grape that contributed to the interesting Chardonnay-like mouthfeel and body. The wine almost borders on flabby, but has a nice complexity on the palate and nose to sort of carry itself. Anyways, this is quite a nice blend with a decent amount of complexity.

Doesn’t seem so bad in retrospect, but I woke up early for a 9AM thing at UBC, took the 99 to the last stop for work, and then needed to travel all the way back to UBC to lead Part 2 of the sort-of-intro-to-wine themed tasting, all while wearing pants that weren’t jeans, one of those shirts you’d hate to spill wine on, and shoes that didn’t fit just enough to make my feet cry. The garb was fitting for all of the day’s events but for this day in particular, I would defs have lead a wine tasting wearing nothing but seven layers of random comfortable 7-foot-long linens, cinnamon-bun-Homer-Simpson style. I was that uncomfortable (ugh rain + sickness). Except I’ve watched enough Project Runway to know that I’d be judged by someone with a German accent. Walk of shame out of the room from elimination. America’s Next Top Wine Tasting? legit For this tasting we tried a French Sauvignon Blanc, an Argentinian Syrah, a Rosé Crémant from Burgundy, and an Italian Brachetto. The former two because they were the noble grapes we hadn’t discussed yet, and the latter two because they were fun and why not. Yay! Along with that whole idea of matching up grape varieties with personalities: Sauvignon Blanc reminds me of an outdoorsy person, and Syrah/Shiraz, the mysterious one. These are probably one of my more fitting comparisons, seeing as Sauvignon Blanc typically has grassy and citrus notes, while Syrah can have red fruit, black fruit, but with a common touch of smokiness or black pepper. Back when one of my best friends bought me a bottle of Syrah for my birthday, I decided to write my first tasting note, knowing jack shit about wine. One of the first things I wrote was “campfire”, which I learned wasn’t totally off. Sauvignon Blanc, while seemingly specific in its characteristics, can definitely vary in character. Razor sharp and mineral-driven versions can be found in the Loire (which I call home to the hipster grape varieties in France), along with mellower versions around Bordeaux, some of which bridge the Old World-New World styles. New Zealand and Chile are examples of notable and amazing regions in which Sauv Blanc can be produced in that aromatic, grassy, and outgoing style opposed to the more elegant and almost furtive style of the Old World. Generally a great seafood pairing, for sure. True story Other things that happened (and which you should feel bad for missing out on) included me eventually succeeding at sabring a bottle of Crémant (hence the title), some kind of grape-eating game, and a push-up contest. It was fun, but I’m not even sure if most of that happened and perhaps the alcohol and long day combined to give me Freudian hallucinations. (Oh well.) AND bread(crumbs)!   Okay, so I lied. This wine is not Sauv Blanc dominated but has other grapes like Colombard and Ugni Blanc, both which provide body and a fruitiness that is reminiscent of a New World wine but still made in that Old World style. Dry, medium-bodied, medium+ acidity, and aromas of grapefruit, citrus, and someone else pointed out that they got pineapple, which is normally weird to get out of Sauvignon Blanc but not out of the question because of the random slosh of grapes thrown into this wine. I also heard honey which I totally see as well. I can see this going well with seafood, but I can also see this going well with a failed midterm and a subpar subsequent pep talk. 15 buckaroos is good for this wine.   This was an interesting one. Definitely fruitier than I expected, but still had that Syrah smokiness. Common descriptors included raspberry, black cherry, and coffee, all which I was proud to hear. Definitely bridges the Old World-New World style much in the same way that the first wine does. Dry, medium-bodied, medium to medium+ acidity, medium tannins. I think. Meatier for sure – I wish the length was a bit longer on this, but otherwise this ain’t bad for 17 bones.   I’m known at work for being a rosé-hater. Confession: I don’t know – when I want a rosé – I do, more than half the wine, want a fruity rosé, and not that savoury shit you get out of most serious rosés like this one. I can’t help it – to me, pink shouts fun and almost into that  off-dry territory, and I psychologically expect that. That being said, this wine super good for its category, and had great light red fruit notes along with that savoury and long finish. Also, this was the point in time where I started paying less and less attention to tasting notes. 27 dollars and very French. Great bubbs. Fantastic value for celebration. 4) NV Toso Brachetto d’Acqui  This was a popular one. Sparkling sweet red – lower in alcohol, probably as a result of an interrupted fermentation (or maybe the Asti method). Quite similar to Moscato with a red fruit kick – almost similar to Lambrusco (in theory – I’ve never had one). Things I heard included strawberries, raspberries, cranberry juice, and raisins. So yeah – basically red sweet fruit on the nose and that dried jammy fruit character on the palate, especially on the finish. Medium-sweet to sweet and medium-bodied, but had a rather low acidity which was thankfully uplifted by some of the sparkle to prevent that cloying character. Quite popular with the group and it’s weird to see the huge general contrast in tastes to people that I serve at the wine store. 20 bucks. But yeah! That’s it for this tasting.

I don’t even care if this is a bottle of complete shit – I’m sold by a combination of both nerdy and religious marketing (Also Michel Rolland’s name is on the label but whatever). With a wine that looks and tastes so extracted, I expected the nose to have more than a mere medium intensity. There were developing aromas of earth, must, baking spices, and dark fruits, and my guess of Shiraz was one of uncertainty – although I did think northern Rhône at one point. The deep colour usually alludes to either a grape with thick skins (and/or small berry sizes) or deliberate extraction. I did note that the nose had some Malbec-y characteristics, but the black and blue fruits were supported by a deeper, darker, and stronger structure. Low and behold – it wasn’t just Malbec or Cabernet or Syrah – it was three (or four, depending on who you are) Bordeaux grapes with their foreign cousins. I was surprised that this was only $25 – I find it’s tough to get good extraction at that price. A large proportion of the class slid it into the “very good” category, which isn’t surprising to me at all – but my first instinct was the “good” category as there was a slight bitterness on the finish that I feel may have stemmed from that deliberate extraction.

As soon as I took a sniff, it was perhaps a mistake to write “muscat? gew?” on my tasting notes before I was done with the entire grid. But it is tough – the pronounced stone fruit, tropical fruit, and spice flavours often allude to a small set of grapes with similar profiles – even the bit of Froot Loops-y cardamom I got on the nose was reminiscent of Viognier, but it turned out to be Muscat. It was the next wine that was Gewurztraminer, which in turn, I had guessed was Muscat. Apparently this is a unique style of Muscat, since drier, more full styles are less common – so a guess of Gew was “more likely” – although the deeper colour of the next wine should’ve hinted to Gew. Muscat is another grape with a reputation for sweeter wines, and, compared to the Riesling example, it’s much more justified this time because it really is hard to find drier versions – but they exist. It already seems one note, but interestingly enough, there are sub-varieties of Muscat, all with slightly different profiles. I believe this was made of the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains variety, which is considered the finest sub-variety of Muscat, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if this was Muscat Ottonel, which is a lower acid, more pungent style of the grape, which finds itself at one of its homes in Alsace.

Where Crémant is the poor-man’s Champagne, Franciacorta and Cava are the hipsters of the European traditional sparkling family.

Rarely do you see Franciacorta in this market, and rarely do you find anyone that knows of it (“you probably haven’t heard of it” –> hipster Champagne?). One time a customer came in asking for Franciacorta – perhaps simply wanting to one-up me on some knowledge – but then we ended up having a sweet conversation on wine. It was great. I left the wine outside instead of the fridge because I thought it would be warmer, but the wine is just as cold as the fridge in this current icy weather. The nose is lovely with ripe green apples, opening up to some autolytic characteristics along with some roasted and slightly salted nut tones, which is impressive for a non-vintage cuvée (or I haven’t been drinking the right ones). Balance is good, and the slightly autolytic green apple notes mirror the nose to the palate, ending with a beautifully roasted nut ending which has just a hint of bitterness.

Picking up complex character is a little easier for sparkling wines, but for some reason the fortified equivalent is much more difficult for me.

This was unmistakably Champagne, if not a very well-made Old World sparkler: autolytic characteristics danced around the sword of piercing acidity while minerality drifted about the tongue, but the wine’s intrigue stems from its subtle Fino sherry-like whispers of oxidation. It’s definitely not even half the savoury brininess that Fino can be (and God forbid had I described this wine as “briny” in class, as I probably would’ve been stoned to death), but there was a marked nutty character which came from the use of oak by the producer, which allowed the wine to hang out with some oxygen molecules. The nuttiness is not so much of an intense almond or brown nut character that you might get from something like an oloroso sherry or an aged white burgundy – it’s more of an elegant and slightly salted white nut sort of melody that gives the wine a bit of a quiet whimsy.

I’m not bragging, because all we get is a wee dram enough for tasting, and God knows I’m poor as fuck from WSET diploma tuition, anyways. This is as close as it gets, except for that time I knocked over my boss’s glass of Château d’Yquem. It shattered all over the floor and in perceived slow motion, I’m sure. Sauternes is a dessert wine from the southern part of Bordeaux; Barsac is something of a subregion of Sauternes, and both are located near other dessert wine appellations: Cérons and Loupiac come to mind, though the actual region of Sauternes is where these dessert wines achieve the best quality. The region, due to the conjoining rivers which surround it, achieves some form of morning mist which encourages Botrytis cinerea to thrive on the grapes, and the fungus develops into the form of noble rot rather than grey rot as the afternoon sun dries the grapes out. What blossoms, as a result, are grapes concentrated with sugars, flavours, and acids, along with a distinct and interesting honeyed Botrytis character – one that I’m still working on describing. There’s something so supernatural and magnificent about harnessing rot, out of all things, to create one of the world’s most expensive and natural drinks. What sets Sauternes apart from other sweet wines in a blind tasting is the liberal usage of oak, which imparts a distinct vanilla scent. This wine is mainly perfumed with stone fruits, with honeyed peach, ripe apricot, and ripe nectarines covered with vanilla cream, along with baking spice, hints of earthy mushroom, and a bit of Botrytis funk. The palate is lusciously full-bodied and mouth-coating, carrying the same flavours on the palate with more intensity. Amazing concentration, length, and complexity – though being so full-bodied and succulent, the wine does lack some freshness and acidity on the palate.

It was also my house “emergency wine”, just in case I decided I wanted to drink today (which evidently I did), and it also served as my reward wine – so I had a goal of studying a certain amount of things (Which happened to be Champagne) before I was allowed to open the wine. I didn’t end up studying as much as I wanted, but I convinced myself that cheap studying meant cheap wine. So there. New vintage. I swear I’ve seen non-vintaged versions of this same bottle, but either way, I’ve also only seen pure Macabeo versions of this wine. This vintage has the addition of Verdejo, which apparently adds to its juiciness – but I’m wondering if the subpar vintage of Europe’s 2012 had anything to do with the decision. You’d think I’d have answers after writing an entire essay about such things. There’s a whole weird smatter of fruits on the nose, but at the same time, the intensity isn’t very loud or defining. There is that subtle pomaceous fruit combined with that of stone fruits, but everything is generally mineral-driven. Same story on the palate, which is slightly more expressive. The lower tartaric acid speaks to the warmer climate of La Mancha, and all I can think of is how much I miss the sun. But the lowerish acid and simplicity does giving it a relaxing and nonchalant feel. It sort of embodies Monday afternoon, even though it’s not the pick-me-up that you might need on such a crappy day of the week. Though I secretly love Mondays. There is a bit of super subtle herbal brush on the nose, but I think that’s because I accidentally snorted a bit of dried marjoram flakes earlier in the day. Good value. It’s a good everyday bottle that’s a nice alternative to the grassier and guava-er Domaine de Grachies that I typically buy (Côtes de Gascogne), and I’ve taken notes like 3 times on that same bottle, but I’ve gotten too inebriated to type anything up about that wine before it’s too late and I forget.

I learned well about herbs that one time I bought a bunch of them to bake chicken, and there was that one golden moment where I’m sure I made the ghosts in the house laugh when I accidentally snorted dried marjoram. There’s a bit of spice and earth as well, and oak isn’t super gaudy on the nose. The palate is ripe and structured but soft, and ripe black cherry notes mingle with hints of vanilla and dark chocolate onto an earthy finish. Acid is there but it’s well-woven – I hope the guy I recommended this to wasn’t scared off, since he was looking for an introductory benchmark Italian wine. I eventually deducted that he wasn’t a big fan of acid, so I treaded carefully.

I was really on the fence on spending that much on a wine (school is expensive!), but through several points including celebration, treating myself because of my new certification, and Thanksgiving itself, I decided to go for it. And so I slowly nursed a bottle of 2007 Domaine des Baumard Trie Spéciale to myself on (Canadian) Thanksgiving. I’m sure no one else around me would have enjoyed a bottle that tasted like cream of mushroom and delicious wet winter sweaters. Savennières is a small appellation in the northern part of Anjou, where dry and concentrated wines from Chenin Blanc are made. Other appellations like Quarts de Chaume, Coteaux du Layon, and Bonnezeaux in the southern parts of Anjou typically make sweeter versions, so Savennières is almost like the weird dry anomaly. It used ti be sweeter in the past, and legally, I still think it can, but why do that, when you can make something weird, dry, and full-bodied, like me? Here we revisit another one of Baumard’s wines – one which I’ve had several times within the past few years. Perhaps I was just in a theatrical mood but my eyes did roll to the back of my head when I tasted it. It’s lusciously strange – much like the 2007 Trie Spéciale, it has a full mushroomy body with lots of mineral, wet wool, and hints of fruit. A classmate asked the instructor whether or not this could age, and she passionately responded “of course!”, and how the wine is currently only starting to show hints of development. The wine is apparently unappetizing at an age less than 7 years, but I suppose this truism can be bypassed for such a great years like 2009. Compared to the 2007 Trie Spéciale, this wine is a bit lighter on the nose and slightly lighter on the palate, but is still full-bodied. Like the 2007, the acid isn’t as super high as I expected, but perhaps this wine is part of the modern camp of Savennières that are made to mature quicker.

I can’t say that I’m an exception. This is the first Pinot Blanc I’ve taken notes on. I’m such a horrible wine parent. As a result of its unpopularity, though, not a lot of people have a true grasp of this variety. A couple of blind guesses of this wine from others included Viognier, Torrontes, and Muscat. I think it’s more akin to the green to stone fruit bowl that is Ehrenfelser, but with a heavier and textured mouthfeel and higher acidity. (It’s hard to say, because Ehrenfelser is more alien to me. Drink more?) This wine is fresh, fruity, but not without a method to its madness. The creamy mouthfeel is gracefully washed away like an ocean wave continually melting a sandcastle, and a slight sassy peach pith tartness at the finish reminds me of the sun. This Pinot Blanc in particular will appeal to the (patriotic) fruit-loving wine-savvy, and I will gracefully bore customers to death about this variety just before they change their mind and leave the store.

Really interesting stuff. Beautiful deep lemon colour, coupled by an interesting nose quite reminiscent of a Vouvray I tried a couple weeks back. Instead, though, the honey and woodier spices were more pronounced, with the fruit taking a bit more of the back seat role in the vehicle that was this wine. Oh man. My analogies. Oxidative notes were present and integrated well with the spice notes. So like, the middle seat of the van. Or the front compartment where you keep your licence and registration.  The palate was really interesting, and the sweetness is really hard to peg. The wine begins with this sweetness, but quickly becomes overtaken by this streak of bitterness and slight acidity that takes over the palate and has this two-toned sort of personality. You sort of get that teasing quality, but it’s more of that alluring sweetness that gradually falls into that bitter badass quality. Very Saoirse Ronan from Hanna. lol my analogies. The body is heavy and has that slightly oily mouthfeel, with just enough acidity to have good structure. After tasting this wine, it reminded me more of a couple (very good value) Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc wines I’ve had in the past, which, while sweet, still had that bitterness to back up the sweetness. Although not Chenin Blanc, I did guess an Old World wine.\nGermany? False.\nFrance? Correct.\n(“Germany wasn’t too far off…”)\nAlsace? Correct. Then I guessed a whole crapload of grapes until I got to Pinot Gris, which surprised me, not only because I’m not a big fan of Pinot Gris, but because I didn’t realize Pinot Gris could have such a distinct character and personality (even though I guess it did remind me of a lot of other wines I’ve had). Like the 2005 Champalou Vouvray, I’d like to (and am afraid to) see what more age can do to this wine, although it’s wonderful as it is right now. I’m going to shamelessly brag that I guessed one year off of the actual vintage  This was delicious, and would maybe make for a great gift, but I can definitely say that there are similar wines that are lesser wallet destroyers, although this was a great example of what Pinot Gris can do.

Typical nose. Compared to other Sauv Blancs from other regions, we get a nose dominated with methoxypyrazines, which I love. It’s a subjective thing, and some people hate them so much even to go as far to consider them as faults, but this wine is chock full of them and should be. This character is reminiscent of that wacky yet loveable kid in class that the teacher always hates on for no reason. The nose is almost salsa-like. Vegetal and then citrus aromas are present, and I can’t help but think of tacos. I think you should pair this (and Chilean Sauv Blancs) with Mexican food.

Three cheers for my liver, and insert that link here. That link everyone’s been sharing on Facebook about how a glass of wine equals an hour at gym or whatever etc etc etc  I read this book called “Wine Politics” by Tyler Colman aka Dr. Vino. The first bit was good but very history-laden (the book focusses on France and the US), and the latter parts discussed lots of contemporary issues involving governmental structure, appellation law, wine popularity, wine critics, and evolving attitudes. Really entertaining and informative if not a bit depressing, seeing how so much of the market is controlled by such big and rich companies who sell monochromatic wine. After I finished the book I felt much more enlightened yet grey clouds started to form as if I’d just bitten into forbidden grapes from the Garden of Eden. Beer that’s delicious; wine that’s auspicious #drunkreading Class was about the South of France and South America, not only in terms of wine but business as well. 9 wines. Oi. Some of them were shit so I guess you gotta make up for it. The non-vintaged Concha Y Toro “Frontera” Merlot ($9) was impressive in my opinion, with a bit of gentle greenness and simple plum, showing – at least – some varietal character despite its bareness. The J.P. Chenet 2013 Pinot Noir ($14), on the other hand, was confected and sort of gross, being simultaneously unripe yet disjointedly and artificially ripe at the same time. I once worked at a store that sold this regularly, and one colleague bought this often because it “looked expensive” and he thought it impressed his girlfriend or something. K. Two blends from the south of France were next: the Domaine Modat 2010 Côtes du Roussillon Villages Caramany ($39) was notably textured and brawny, with lots of evolved black fruit and spice, while the Hecht & Bannier 2011 Saint-Chinian ($30) had more tar and garrigue notes to display, though its body was a bit lighter. Some whites in the middle to refresh our palates I suppose (though I thought both of them were kinda gross), and despite their blandness they illustrated something, at least, with the French Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2013 Sauvignon Blanc ($13) showing much less grassy character than the Chilean Veramonte 2013 Sauvignon Blanc ($14), because the grapes from the former were grown in a much generally warmer and thus less suitable climate for Savvy Blanc. I didn’t even pick up on the grassiness in the first wine (why are tasting Pinot Grigio in this class?) and so I ventured a vague guess of Picpoul. I still think the Chilean wine was kinda only okay but I’d pick it over that first one any day. Carmenere was bound to appear somewhere in the flight, with its tomato soup head evaporating from the glass and into all of our noses. The Bisquertt 2012 “Ecos de Rulo” Carmenere ($20) had lots of meaty fruit to support the tomato leaf character which was rather nice. In comparison, the Intriga 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon ($28) seemed so earthy and herb-scented that I definitely thought it was a Cahors chosen to provide a contrast to the last wine – the Vistalba 2012 “Corte C” ($20) – in the flight, but alas, it was a Chilean Cab.

Usually.).  And ironically enough, this was like sparkling white Beaujolais Nouveau and happened to get a solid 2.5 stars. It was like an alcoholic theme park, with aromas of things like bubble gum, cotton candy, and pear drops, and immediately I think of how dangerous gateway wines like these are. This shit goes down like pop (or, is spit out because I’m in WSET class, *ahem*) – the low acidity has carbonation for its uplifting saving grace, and the sweet impression gives a bit of a crowd-pleasing charm.

This taste comparison was obviously set up to show the differences between a rosé Crémant and a rosé Champagne. Disappointingly enough, it was hard to pick up those definitive toasty notes in one of these wines and not the other. Amusingly enough, what this comparison showed was the potential for great Crémants to exist, something which is apparently not a common thing. Plenty of delicate bubbles, and there was some stinky yeastiness on the nose, along with some light red fruit notes. At face value, this is not an orgasmic wine, but compared to the Champagne, this stole the show – though it’s entirely possible that the wines chosen were simply uneven examples of what they actually are. For those who don’t know – in a nutshell, Crémants are French sparkling wines made in the traditional method but are made outside of the Champagne area – therefore, they can get those signature toasty and bready notes one would typically find in Champagne, especially when made with Chardonnay and Pinot Noir – though with Crémants, the varietals used vary according to the appellations, and Crémants can often be lacklustre. But yes – it was hard to find the difference between the two wines (perhaps the non-vintageness of the Champagne?) If you’re looking for something fun and pink and good quality, go for this.

It was pathetically amazing. So there. Moscato d’Asti is such a crowd pleaser. A typical one will be sweet but light, along with beautiful fruity and floral notes. I recall aromas of lychee, green apples, notes of stone fruit, and oranges. It had a medium sweetness with a perfect balance of acidity to clean off the palate. I thought that it would be great to bring back for a Valentine’s Day-themed wine tasting session at UBC – out of a rosé, a Cava, and an Amontillado, this Moscato d’Asti was the traditional and more subtle personality of the wines, with Cava being the adventurous, the Amontillado being the strategic, and the rosé being the hopeless romantic. I only know of one person who didn’t really enjoy this wine – which I respect, but then again, among his favourite wines are White Zinfandels (oh God, I’m “that guy”, aren’t I?). I made a Justin Bieber White Zinfandel joke one time for a tasting I led at UBC, and people actually laughed, which made me feel all cool and stuff. Although a good choice for your friends that “don’t really like wine”, it’s sort of a shame that Moscato d’Asti can perhaps be a little expensive or perhaps lacking in variety at times, but perhaps this is only true in BC. I’m starting to see similar wines that are less expensive (and perhaps less complex) pop up, and although Moscato (d’Asti) may be seen as a less serious quaffing-type summer wine, it’s good to see some variety. It’s the one type of wine many of the executives and I at the UBC’s wine tasting club agree to keep bringing back, because everyone seems to like it.

What I remember is that the flavour profile was very similar to the second wine in our flight but with slightly more complexity with scents of cigar boxes and brushes of mint along with the developing fruit. Now that I remember it, there was probably a discussion on how wine from Graves, which is in the southern part of Bordeaux, generally matures quicker than more structured wine from the left bank. Perhaps evident with the classmate who read her notes – she thought this was from the 2006 vintage and at a level of outstanding quality. I and some others couldn’t find as much complexity as she did, and indeed this was generally agreed upon as a level down in quality at “very good”, and very good it was: I remember taking notice that this was great at $37.

The palate is juicy, light and has a bit of tartness. I prefer more zip to my off-dry Riesling, but the slightly more tropical expression coupled with the low acid gives this wine a bit more of a relaxed edge, almost like a Riesling-Torrontes lovechild.

The answer is maybe. Anyways, I’m told I have like half an hour before we leave for breakfast. It’s finally the day that the pre-excursion for the Wine Bloggers Conference 2015 starts – so Christine, Amy, Leeann, Sujinder and I pack up, eat breakfast at a place (i.e. delicious instant-regret-omelettes), and drive back to Elmira where some of us enjoy Gin and Tonics at the airport to revitalize our brains. Some fellow bloggers began arriving: some remember that we met last year, where I was plagued by lots of self-doubt more than the capacity to retain faces and names (ugh what a great start), and we all board the pre-excursion bus on the way to Villa Bellangelo. Hi, my name is Josh. Oh, we’ve met before? Do I, like, awkwardly take back my business card or? Swag swag swag and goodies are what we begin with, and also bumpy bus rides involving wine! We’re given glasses but also spit cups – we soon discover that none of us really has enough limbs to hold anything, so Christine and I share a waste cup with one of our four hands. At one point our bus avoids a collision and someone’s spit cup goes flying and I swear that I feel a splash on my right calf. Rock Stream 2013 Dry Cayuga White (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $13\nApparently, the Cayuga White grape is a Riesling lookalike. Hay and lemons on the nose. Relatively Riesling-like on the palate, I guess, with vague piercing citrus. Rock Stream 2013 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $15\nDusty floral perfume on the nose – almost rosemary. A burst of lemon tea on the palate with a pale finish. Rock Stream 2010 Cabernet Franc (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nThe nose reveals mostly meaty tomato leaf, menthol, and a bit of cherry. Velvety cooked raspberries on the palate with zippy black cherry and fine light tannin. Seneca Shore Pinot Grigio (Finger Lakes, New York) $15\nA bit of SO2 on the nose? Crisp and fresh lemon seed on the palate, maybe a hint of grapefruit? Correct if not slightly dull but maybe needs to open up. Seneca Shore Riesling Semi-Dry (Finger Lakes, New York) $13\nMuted. A bit stony – herbaceous maybe? Quite zippy and electric and much drier than I expected. Seneca Shore Queen Charlene’s Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes, New York) $12\n100% Pinot Noir, and named after the winemaker’s wife or something kind of cute. Almost like a still version of a particular Crémant rosé, with a lightly floral nose, red fruit, and ripe pear. Easily the best of the Seneca Shore wines we tasted by far. We’re warmly greeted at the beautiful Villa Bellangelo, where a glass of rosé and an opening speech by Chris Missick (owner) is followed by four stations: an area with bits and bites, a station with a flight of Riesling, a station with something like a 10-year vertical of Cabernet Sauvignon (immediate gasp from the group of bloggers) from King’s Garden Vineyards, and a sort of in-between miscellaneous Villa Bellangelo table. My current emotion: enjoying life with shorts that need ironing. Also, that’s a tube of lip balm. I’m stubborn so I come with the mission to try and taste everything. Everyone obviously goes to the table with the Cab vertical and I rush right over to the Riesling table because in this moment I am a Riesling cheerleader sporting a sleeveless shirt instead of a short skirt. I’m absorbed and focussed to the point where a fellow blogger approaches the table, places her hand on my shoulder, and jokingly tells me I don’t need to hog the space. In my mind I was having a Real Housewines of New York confessional monologue about how I couldn’t believe I was dealing with this instead of taking a picture of myself outside on the patio milking a goat, but I knew she was mostly jesting and okay fine maybe I was hogging the table shh. I made it partway through the miscellaneous table before we were told our time was up. Ugh – this is interrupted elementary school recess all over again. Also, click here to see local coverage on this particular event including a partially flattering one-second clip of me jotting something down. Yes. Bellangelo 2013 Rosé (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $13\n30% Pinot Noir, 30% Cabernet Franc, 40% Chardonnay. Flowers, watermelon, and pear, maybe a hint of raspberry bubble gum. Dry, light, pretty. Rieslings, poured by Dan Bissell (assistant winemaker) and Nathan Kendall (head winemaker): Bellangelo 2012 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York) $19\nAND SO IT BEGINS. Lime and liquid stones. Glacial and icy, sort of like Meryl Streep in the Devil Wears Prada? Bellangelo 2013 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $18\n7% aged in neutral French oak for 3 months. A little more honeyed and friendly, but still mostly edgy lime. So like Meryl Streep towards the end of said movie. Bellangelo 2014 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nDefinitely has the most fruit intensity of the Dry Rieslings, with some grass and grapefruit reminiscent of Sauvignon Blanc. Some Granny Smith apple here and there. Unreleased? Bellangelo 2012 “1866 Reserve” Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York) $32\nWe glide into petrol territory here, with an off-dryness accented by peach and lemon. Elegant and gossamer but taut and concentrated. Bellangelo 2012 Riesling Semi Dry (Finger Lakes New York) $?\nA hint of something slightly skunky or herbaceous though I’m still sort of into it. There’s a pinch of well-balanced sweetness with some stone fruit. Bellangelo 2011 Riesling Semi Dry (Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nA bit muted fruit on the nose with something smoky, and then there’s an intriguing meatiness on the palate that replaces the colourfulness in previous examples. Bellangelo 2014 Riesling [dropped “semi-dry” designation] (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nLeafy, stony, with lots of grapefruit and even a hint of durian. Off-dry but quite bright. Bellangelo 2013 Riesling Semi Dry (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $18\n17% aged in neutral French oak for three months. Quiet stone fruit, something pollen-like, and muted honey. Medium-dry and textured; definitely the most slutty of the lot. Lots of lime and margarita and things. Is “semi-dry” starting to sound like a really good baby name or no? Bellangelo 2012 “Gibson Vineyard” Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York) $22\nA bit shy on the nose, but then an explosion of honeyed white peach on the palate. Interested to see what this could do with age. I might lazily re-use a terrible “Riesling to the occasion” joke. And, the others, poured by Becky (friendly knowledgable awesome human): Bellangelo 2013 Dry Chardonnay (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nLarge proportion was oaked for 8 months with full malolactic fermentation. Reminds me of that Connecticut Chardonnay I had just a couple of days ago: steely but buttery with oak. Personally, I could use more fruit intensity to balance the scale. Bellangelo 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $15\n30% Chardonnay Musqué. Skunky? Maybe a hint of cork taint? I doubt myself so I made some other friends smell this and we agreed that the particular bottle was maybe off but we couldn’t agree on why. Need to retry. Bellangelo 2013 “1866 Reserve” Gewurztraminer (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $32\nClassy and a bit more more hushed for Gew. One sniff and I’m pretty sure I was transported to someone’s grandma’s quaint bathroom that smells dainty and floral and definitely has a pastel colour palate along with a fuzzy pink toilet cover. Aged in neutral French oak for 10 months. Bellangelo 2012 Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nStill elegant but spicier rather than flowery. Off-dry but barely, and with stony restraint. I vibe with this wine. Bellangelo 2013 Seyval Blanc (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $16\nLovely and graceful with something buttery but not quite? Greek yoghurt perhaps? Odd because this has been aged in 100% stainless steel with no malolactic. Off-dry and intense lemon sorbet on the palate. I’m impressed with a Seyval Blanc and I feel weird about it. Bellangelo “Bella Fresca” $?\nChardonnay, Gewurztraminer, Seyval Blanc, Cayuga White, and Muscat – I think? Didn’t get to spend much time with this and I don’t trust my tasting note but this perhaps had a bit of a weird and slightly herbaceous character.

This second wine was the complete opposite, with super-restrained flavours hiding behind a shield of acid and maybe just a hint of texture. Everyone and I thought this was a Muscadet, which is a Loire wine made from the super-neutral Melon de Bourgogne grape. The grape is moulded into a textured and yeasty wine by processes involving storing the wine over fine lees (dead yeast cells), so all of it made sense, and almost everyone thought this was one of acceptable to good quality – lifeless but satisfactory. So it turns out this was a 63-dollar wine from a well-reputed producer. This shocked everyone in the class, and my request to revisit the wine for a second pour was mirrored by everyone else. It was just so neutral – a dumb phase, perhaps, requiring a bit of age to open up, plus, possibly, a relatively tougher vintage which shrouded the wine from being its usual self. There was some texture and a longer finish that bumped up the quality, according to instructor, and maybe the acid was unbalanced in this case, which, like the vintage, veiled the wine from its true elements. A bit of a mineral funkiness found itself on both the nose and the palate, but the whole flavour profile was so quiet to begin with that you’re not sure whether or not you’re picking these things out of nowhere. Apparently this is a Loire Sauvignon Blanc that’s supposed to emphasize terroir unlike the previous wine in the flight which was punchier and more “obviously Sauvignon Blanc” in style.

When Brandon Seager – the Chair of the Winemaking Department at Tompkins College, Winemaker, and Finger Lakes Wine Country LGBT Ambassador (cool, I didn’t even know that was a thing!) – used Brad Pitt analogies and pictures to explain the nuances of wine aging, I knew that I had chosen the right seminar. Huzzah. The wines were what I was mostly looking forward to, especially the aged ice wine, which can be quite a divisive topic when it comes to cellaring wine. Opponents of the idea believe that ice wine is best drunk as fresh as possible, as fresh as newly-fallen snow to emphasize the bright and concentrated sweet flavours that bounce in the mouth with flashes of glitter and brightness. But our example was wonderfully delicious, with bright fruit replaced by more caramelized flavours. Perhaps I need to rethink my thoughts when it comes to cellaring Canadian ice wine. Experiments are in order, obvi. Later that day, there was a casual tasting on the wines of the world. Brazilian wines? YES. Bring me there. And of course, I also decided to channel my energy into trying some Tuscan wines before the week’s conclusion. I needed some of that Old World Sangio in my life to balance out the week on New York Riesling. This will by my last post on the 2015 Wine Bloggers Conference, I think (phew!). I did count my tasting notes on the week and it looks like I had 190 in total, but I’ve cut it down to 133 due to some illegibility (duh…) among other reasons – which means, of course, that I’m skipping writing about some events. Which sucks! But it happens. A great conference, and I can’t wait for Lodi in 2016. “…and the worst. Beware of the Pinots.” Hermann J. Weimer 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium lemon. Aromatics led by lime, citrus zest, and lots of a smoky chalky slaty character. That moment between dry and off-dry; there’s more fruit on the palate expressed as zippy peach that dances on the tongue. Almost like hard candy. A bit shorter than I expected but still delicious. Dr. Konstantin Frank 2008 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York)\nGolden hue. Jammy apricots on the nose along with chalk and a scent I can only describe as weird flowers. Medium dry and with fruit that’s trying to claw its way through the refreshing acid. Honeyed at the end. Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium garnet. Mint and green pepper, along with dark chocolate, dried raspberries, soil, and a hint of soy sauce. Dry and velvety, bordering on the fuller side of things, with lighter slightly chalky tannin. Long and suede-like. Casa Larga 2005 Fiori Delle Stelle Vidal Ice Wine (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium amber colour. Blast of caramelized mango and a bit of smoked fish (this combination: Philippines, is that you?). Luscious with mouth-coating tropical fruit cooked in brown sugar. Long, and the acid doesn’t fail to illuminate the wine.  Salton Brut (Serra Gaúcha, Brazil)\nPerfumed with lots of flowers and peach; off-dry and savoury with creamy mousse. Salton 2012 “Intenso” Cabernet Franc (Campanha, Brazil)\nCherry cola with hints of herbs. A bit sticky but pleasantly soft and warm. Salton 2012 “Intenso” Tannat (Campanha, Brazil)\nEarth, dark fruit, and blackberry skin; quite ripe in fruit with slightly chalky tannins. Quite open-knit with fair amounts of glitz and glitter. Salton 2009 “Talento” (Campanha and Serra Gaúcha, Brazil)\nCabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Tannat. All of plums, mint, and spice. Very ripe and open, even unashamed and naked. Savoury. A bit over the brim. Villa Trasqua 2013 Toscana Rosso (Toscana, Italy)\nMostly Sangiovese with just a pinch of Alicante Bouschet. Though mainly consisting of dried red fruit, it’s very soft, welcoming, and smiling. Almost seems un-Sangiovese-like but not without a bit of Italian scratch to the texture. Villa Trasqua 2011 “Evoluto” Chianti Classico (Chianti Classico, Toscana, Italy)\n95% Sangiovese with Colorino and Malvasia Nera. 18 months in Slavonian oak. Mostly sweaty plums, red fruit, cherry, and dried herbs. Ripe fruit contributing to the roundness, with a substantial amount of chalky structure. Villa Trasqua 2009 “Fanatico” Chianti Classico Riserva (Chianti Classico, Toscana, Italy)\n100% Sangio. More spice, smoke, and fruit that tends over to the darker side of things. At this age it seems on its way to loosening the ripe tannin, but it’s still quite alive and ripe on the palate.

I’m sure we tried an aged Saint-Émilion as well, but something remarkable that comes out of BC is just mind blowing. Wah wahhhh. Just kidding.

They may have cut that scene from the film? Originally there were simply three appellations for Alsace, and you may still very well group them in that way: there’s regular Alsace, there’s Crémant d’Alsace (sparkling), and then there’s the Grand Cru appellation which implies higher quality than the regular, but of course it’s still a subject of controversy. The 51 grand cru vineyards vary in size, the larger ones perhaps not being consistent with grape quality depending on the size and varying soils of the vineyard. Some producers jump on the grand cru vineyard bandwagon for easy cash, and some producers even omit the fact that they use fruit from grand cru vineyards because they choose not to promote the questionable status. Anyways, I really liked this wine. There was a lot of evolved fruit in this Riesling: along with bits of petrol, there were tons of ripe green and baked fruit, some ripe stone fruit, a bit of spice, and honey. Potpourri, even. The wine was so weirdly reminiscent of autumn to me, almost evoking some sort of Windows XP desktop background. Autumnal spice like wafting leaves, and high acids like brisk winds. Had I had this wine described to me before tasting it, I might not have guessed Riesling. There was a hypothesis by one or two in the class that this wine may have been cooked or stored improperly, though that’s still a process I’m still trying to fully understand.

Oz Clarke waxes poetic about how hot and bothered he gets by (good) Viognier, and so I hopped on that train and thought this was Viognier. A nose from what I thought was more citrus and stone fruit dominated was more green fruit-centric in the experienced mind of the instructor (although there was a agreed-upon and marked nectarine character), but I was correct in detecting a yoghurt-y baked custard sort of characteristic both on the nose and palate, stemming from the good ol’ malolactic fermentation. I’m guessing that this is what Oz might be referring to with the whole crème fraîche thing. (Condrieu is still on the spit bucket list.) That, and this isn’t exactly what I think of when I think of Pinot Blanc. I finally understand the whole comparison to Chardonnay, but most Pinot Blancs I’ve had have been simple, fruity, lighter in body, and have never reached this complexity. Combined with the fact that “Pinot Blanc” from Alsace may actually be a blend of that and Auxerrois (and in some cases may be all Auxerrois and no Pinot Blanc at all, much like Trebbiano d’Abruzzo), and you have a sad and ignored little grape that gets beat up by all the other macho grapes after school. The colour and ripeness makes sense to me, here, because Alsace (and I assume southwest Germany by extension, assuming no strong geographical difference) is generally a dry and sunny area. Sunny areas in southern Germany can lead to riper  and fuller-bodied styles of the variety. I recall week 2 – my embarrassing guess of Alsace Riesling as some oddly bright Chardonnay. This was a fantastic and unique wine. Don’t go chasing it down anytime soon, because the heartbreaking fact is that German Pinot Blancs are rare in this market (maybe one in the BCL), and the shape of the Bocksbeutel inconveniences both restaurants and storage units. That didn’t stop Mateus, but this isn’t Mateus.

As last week’s quasi-quasi-quasi-quasi-bulk purchase of 400 flash cards (surprisingly) wasn’t enough, I went ahead and bought 1000 today. Of course, no trip is complete without visits to other private liquor stores in the area (that I’ve never been to) so why not? Go for flash cards, come back with wine. A mistake? Perhaps. Yes. A large proportion of my day was spent sitting at Starbucks and debating whether or not I should buy one or a combination of the following wines that I promised the sales clerk that I would return for after mulling it over: a 1990 Champagne (on clearance), a 1996 Barsac, a 2000 Barsac (same producer), a Blanquette Méthode Ancestrale (doux style), or a cold White Zinfandel (as much as I hate to admit: I was craving something like this. STOP JUDGING ME!). My ridiculous purchase of the Torres Jaime I Brandy last week (not to mention WSET Diploma tuition, for that matter) was enough to convince myself that I needed to chill out with the spending. I’m waiting to crack open the brandy as a celebratory Unit 2 test results excuse – but let’s be real: it’s WSET, and I’m probably not going to get my results for a while. Although still not the cheapest thing, I went with the Blanquette, since I’ve had the dry version, and because I’ve never had a “doux”-designated French sparkler. Also, it’s summer. The nose is interesting: dominant with ripe and juicy red apple, in contrast to the elegant greener and crunchier apple notes of Champagne, and it doesn’t veer into other tree fruit notes (say, stone fruits), which a sparkler like Moscato (d’Asti) can often do. Reminiscent of apple cider. The nose also shows hints of almond and an unmistakable presence of a toasty bready character, the latter which can disappointingly be absent from more traditionally made sparklings. The palate echoes the flavours on the nose, and almost ties in the individual elements: this tastes like apple strudel with almond flakes and hints of honey drizzle. Delicious. Varietally correct, according to Jancis, who gives the grape variety a short but concisely sweet entry in her Wine Grapes compendium. If the Loire was hipster, then sparkling Languedoc is the stuff that the stuff has never heard of. Structurally, the wine has acidity, but just enough to balance the medium-sweet character. The “doux” designation means that this wine has at least 50 grams of sugar per litre, so acidity is key. More zip would have been nice, but as always, the bubbles give a bit of a textural lift. Average length. This is one of those wines that is friendly enough to please those with sweet teeth but is obscure enough to intrigue the alcohol nerds.

What a shame, because this was a terrific wine. It’s a confusion as to why I can hardly find information on this Château on both the internet and in Oz Clarke’s most recent Bordeaux compendium. Ninja Bordeaux? Of the four most known appellations of left bank Bordeaux, Saint-Estèphe is probably the hipster of the four – where Pauillac is known for its power and Margaux for its silkiness (and small Saint-Julien for his balance between the two), Saint-Estèphe finds character in what Oz Clarke describes as “an earthy scratch to the texture, no matter how refined the estate nor how well matured the wine might be”. Though the appellation can also have the reputation for being the slowest to mature, the wines tend to be of great value – like this one, I would argue, at $48. Despite the time that some Saint-Estèphe needs, we do find more instant drinkers in riper years like this one, and a discussion in class about age was brought up. One argued that this would peak in about 5 years, where there would be a nice balance between fruit and famous aged Bordeaux characteristics – but it’s hard to generalize when preferences differ. Chosen to display a blend of three grapes we studied today (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc, and I suppose Petit Verdot), this wine was impressive with a good structure, long length, and a concentrated palate, equating to being on the higher end of “very good” or the lower end of “outstanding”. Further complexity and a more harmonized alcohol would give it a higher quality, although it’s already pretty damn good to begin with. I noticed a bit of that Saint-Estephe abrasiveness but that might have been the power of suggestion. Oh – and despite my cold, I pretty much nailed all the non-flavour parameters. Insert fist pump here. For some reason I find myself fascinated with this part of Bordeaux opposed to the others, and it’s perhaps unsurprising that Tom Stevenson of The Sotheby’s Wine Encyclopedia describes Saint-Estèphe as the “least sexy of the Médoc’s famous four appellations”.

Yes, I am that asshole (with traditional method sparkling rosés), and I’ve always been wary of them ever since my first exposure. I’m watching you, TMSRs! (This reminded me a lot of the NV Lugny Crémant de Bourgogne Rosé, and I thought it was at first. Hence the guess.) I may have mentioned it in a previous post, but traditionally-made sparkling rosé is a bit of a liquid sphinx. Phenolics from red grape skins somehow cancel out the majority of toasty autolytic character (even if just a small portion of the cuvée), and you’re left with the replacement delicate red fruit notes, some of the typical pomaceous fruit, the creamy mousse, and austere structure. But combine this with the fact that producers sometimes struggle to be consistent with colour and style every year, and it almost doesn’t make sense to me that top dollar goes to something so non-autolytic and relatively delicate and light like rosé Champagne. On one point, it sort of makes sense because alternatives can really be ferocious, with the cherry and cranberry-scented rosé Cavas that might don brutish bubbles and sometimes less balance to boot. So rosé Champagnes do intrigue me the most (as do the people that drink them more regularly than the common peasant, like me), but then again, I guess that’s where the better-valued rosé Crémants come in.

Unfortunately, it was like a love never re-discovered, because as a new wine drinker back then, I was ignorant of the fact that cheap, good, and concentrated Zinfandel doesn’t exist or is hard to find. Through consumer patterns, I often find that Zinfandel is a polarizing grape that I’m almost afraid to suggest to people in fear of a 1/2 chance of automatic disgust due to some form of negative reputation. Quite ironically, the grape almost grows in the same chancy fashion: the individual berries in a bunch of Zinfandel grapes ripen at different times, often resulting in overripe grapes if one has to wait for all of the berries to be at least acceptably ripe: such a gamble, and thusly I’m calling Zinfandel “the Gambler” grape.

Who’d’ve thunk it? I’m not a big fan of Pinot Grigio, and even recently, one of my newer co-workers and I excitedly burst into complete excitement into how we both disliked this particular variety. “Oh my God, you hate Pinot Grigio, too?!” It’s very middle-of-the-road and generally crowd-pleasing: its characteristics don’t seem to reach many extremes very often. Acidity, body, intensity, and so on, are usually kept in check, which perhaps gives the quaffable and enjoyable quality – unfortunately, this varietal seems to lack character at the same time, which I find happens in many Italian whites. On the other hand, there is a large crowd that this caters to, and that neutral, crisp, medium-everything characteristic wins over consumers who don’t like their wines to be dominated with fruit. These are the customers who firstly state that they don’t want a “sweet” wine, but half of the time I’m confident that they really mean “fruity”. That being said, I always like to suggest alternatives to people, just to broaden horizons. I’ll suggest a heavier Alsace Pinot Gris, for example, or perhaps a Portuguese Vinho Verde or Spanish Albariño. But there’s no doubt that Pinot Grigio is a very fashionable grape. My impressions of Pinot Grigio were probably muddled with over-negativity, because I was surprised that this wine in particular was of this grape. Although my mind wasn’t blown, I was slightly impressed by the nutty and floral complexity that this wine displayed, and this has been my go-to Pinot Grigio ever since even though that’s somewhat of a personal oxymoron (ha).", "price": "$ 22 (Liberty)", "abv": "12.5%", "vintage": "2010", "color": "White", "overall": "Good quality; drink now.", "region": "Italy", "eyes": "clear, pale lemon, watery rim", "sub_region": "Alto Adige Südtirol", "mouth": "dry, med+ to high acidity, med body, med+ intensity, med to med+ alcohol, med length, citrus, minterality", "name": "2010 Tolloy Pinot Grigio", "nose": "clean, med intensity, youthful to developing, almond, floral, neutral + vague fruit", "variety": "Pinot Grigio", "producer": "Tolloy"}, {"link": "<a href='http://www.joshlikeswine.com/2014/05/03/1997-dr-burklin-wolf-ruppertsberger-gaisbohl-r-riesling-auslese/' target='_blank'>http://www.joshlikeswine.com/2014/05/03/1997-dr-burklin-wolf-ruppertsberger-gaisbohl-r-riesling-auslese/</a>", "description": "It’s a Friday night. I’ve been home all day studying (and recovering from last night, for that matter) just to give myself an excuse to open something fantastic given I work through this fat stack of Champagne flash cards (which I did). So here we are, and I really wish I had a third arm that could possibly aid me in sipping some of this wine as I type with two of my normal human hands. Sex must be weirdly fantastic with a person that has three arms, but I guess it would depend where that hand exuded from the body. Are these the thoughts that flow through my mind with Auslese? Because I’m pretty sure picking out wedding colours comes with drinking white Rioja. Anyways, I decided upon this bottle realizing how odd of a value it was – $38 for an Auslese older than 15 years is a steal. Two years ago, we had tried the 1995 Zilliken Riesling Auslese Saarburger Rausch in class, which was deemed a good deal at $59. Though that particular wine was in a slightly different style being from the Mosel, it really puts into perspective how fantastic this bottle is at 38 bones, and it makes you wonder what the fuck is wrong with it if at all anything. But it seems stupendous so far, and maybe I’m just extra excited that I’m no longer fruitlessly attempting to remember the dates at which some Champagne houses were established. Oy. The wine. Dominated by ripe and baked pomaceous fruit, honey, and a present stroke of earthy and smoky minerality. A scoopful of the petrol we expect from Riesling but definitely much less than other aged German wines I’ve had. The palate is unctuous and full-bodied (I guess, sort of like me) – and it begins with a bit of sweetness but ends with a mini-streak of dry, spicy, and juicy minerality, almost bringing to mind an Alsatian Pinot Gris I’ve shamelessly poured into my head at one point. It’s interesting but less so than other Auslesen I’ve had in the past, not to say that this was terrible. The price is still a steal. The compelling sweet entry to dryish finish reminds me of the equally as compelling character with a heaping side of shady badassery, sort of like Cersei Lannister (who I absolutely love by the way – suck it), or Bree Van de Kamp.

Ironically, the bulk of us are on vacation in a couple of weeks. Last year’s conference was in Penticton, i.e. it was literally super close to home, so I really do deserve a slap on the wrist for missing that one. I couldn’t resist not going to attend this year’s conference in Santa Barbara – first, California. Wine. Hi. Second, it would provide me with a fabulous answer for anyone that would ask what I was up to this summer, and I wouldn’t have to come up with a fancy complicated way to say “nothing”. Easy sell! It was an intense whirlwind of wine, people, and vineyards. I figure that the only way to neatly communicate what I’ve taken away from the conference is to do some sort of David Letterman slash Buzzfeed-esque top 10 countdown. Dreadful! I’m doing it anyways, just like that cheap 1L bottle of plonk I bought last week. I swear, I was holding it for a friend!  I can name the 60-something châteaux of the 1855 Bordeaux classification, but watch me get lost in a large airport. I don’t travel very often. I could, but the angel on the shoulder of my wallet says I probably shouldn’t, and so I’m definitely in a sea of complete unknownness when it comes to travelling alone. Thank God for fellow wine friends Valerie and Donita for being my partners during the trip. LAX was a weird Pan’s Labyrinth of an airport with odd terminals and airport announcements that for some reason sounded like grumbled up horror movie ransom audio, but fortunately we found the correct terminal that would take us to Santa Barbara. Donita was a former travel agent, so her patience while guiding me through travel stuff on the phone – weeks before the trip – was awesome. Gold stars and hugs for you both! What sort of person doesn’t say they’ve been bitten by this stupid proverbial travel bug after a good trip? Come a couple weeks time, I’m heading off to see more wine country. It’s time for the Okanagan – I’m really just making up for lost time (and drunkenness) last year. obligatory  Perhaps I’m shooting myself in the foot for even mentioning this. Greetings, potential employers! Naw, I’m just not used to it. Getting my business cards in the mail evoked a slightly adult-like sensation despite my blog’s dopey logo on the front. Huzzah – these were the bits of Josh I’d give out to people. Don’t get me wrong – I like people, I like talking to people, I’m not afraid of talking to people. But the oft-insincere action of meeting someone for thirty seconds and then moving on to the next person for the sake of getting a business card weirds me out. It’s even cringeworthy when you’re seeing it happen and the people are definitely tossing around fake giggles and smiles while they shamelessly try to shove their product down someone’s throat. But I’m sure I’m just being a complete ass about the whole thing. Maybe I’m repressing a hilarious memory that’ll make for an embarrassing story. That sounds about right.  I really didn’t think I would get anything out of applying for the scholarship. I went for it anyways to see what would happen – I eventually got chosen, which was awesome – like 15-minute-dance-party-at-1AM awesome. And I really really really hate to sound like I’m being self-righteous here, but the fact that I was chosen perhaps means that someone on the scholarship committee saw something in me, perhaps a thing that can be eventually moulded into something useful or cool. Something Tyra Banks would give me a sassy motivational speech about. I don’t know. But I sure did feel fuzzy inside. There’s really not a modest way of talking about what the scholarship means to me. I’m a young wine student who works in wine retail, with a dopey blog in a wine world full of wine businesspeople and cool sommeliers. Conferences like this, I realize (e.g. see #4) help me not only learn about wine and the regions of focus but help realize how I fit – and how I want to fit – in the industry. You can buy wine, but experience is a tough thing to get your hands on. So I’m grateful for this whole experience, really. And to that, I once again thank the sponsors for the experience and the motivation to do something great instead of sitting in my pyjamas on my laptop at 3PM. Instead, I can sit down in my pyjamas on my laptop at 3PM with a glass of wine and be motivated to write something awesome. My only regret is that I only got to meet some of you and not all of you.   Okay – so WSET Diploma tasting exams are timed, and so are tasting exams (verbally for the higher levels) for the Court of Master Sommeliers. Enter the speed tasting event of the WBC. Along with tasting concisely while attempting to listen to the wine reps and forming a hopefully witty tweet around a wine, there’s the added challenge of not spilling anything on your laptop. I was thankfully successful, unlike that 10-dollar Cabernet Sauvignon incident of November 2012 nor the Belgian Rye IPA incident of a couple of June 2014. I think that in those cases I definitely wasn’t drinking fast enough. Or maybe I should stop placing my glasses right in front of my laptop and being a klutz. There was also a mini party in our room with 80s music playing on my laptop – it’s a wonder nothing spilled on my laptop due to (my) flailing arms during anything Madonna-related.  i.e. Carl’s Jr. runs at 3AM.    Sure – there’s Napa, there’s Sonoma. That’s what people think about when the idea of Californian wine comes to mind, with matching big jammy reds and heavily oaked and creamed corn-scented Chardonnays to boot. I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect when planning to march off to Santa Barbara, but I guess that was the point – to explore a smaller and quieter region with more finessed and refreshing whites, to the grittier reds that still contained the new world spirit of California. I suppose with a smaller region and even smaller appellations (like the one my bus explored, Happy Canyon AVA), there’s a really cool sense of support and camaraderie between the handfuls of wineries that are in each small region. That’s definitely one thing I enjoyed.  The keynote speech of the Wine Bloggers Conference seems like the de facto sit-down event of the conference. I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect, and I was looking forward to it, but for some reason, sometimes listening to motivational speeches gives me the creepy crawlies. So my ease sort of melts away during the keynote speech, and I’m sitting there questioning everything while mostly everyone’s eyes light up like they’re being fed inspirational lightbulbs. There’s the usual stuff – welcome to the conference, it’s been going strong for 7 years, my name is Corbett Barr, etc. We learn how blogging is different for wine compared to other subjects that are blogged about: few earn a living compared to other subjects, the wine blogging community isn’t as tight, there aren’t as many industry-level bloggers, and the number of leaders are relatively few. We come to the hopeful conclusion that wine blogging isn’t at its “golden age”, and we address certain roadblocks and ways to overcome them. I find it difficult to identify with the bulk of these roadblocks simply because my “mission” is mostly embryonic or simply nonexistent. Two years ago, my blog started off as a collection of tasting notes that veered into the direction of reviews, but eventually levelled off into a goal of nihility. My blog was – and perhaps still is – a dimly lit closet made up of one part scrapbook and one part diary, and whoever decided to peer into its dusty contents was surely welcome. But I do it for no direct “purpose”, which is perhaps why my About Me page seems like a bit of an egotistic and malformed resumé without any sort of promise of provision. My blog mostly just serves to be some sort of weird egotistic extension of self. So much that these solutions to addressing said “roadblocks” feel like we’re trying to find ways to change who I am. Which obviously wasn’t the message, but the speech evoked a big Question that’ll be the next big Thing I’ll have to address: do I need a more direct mission or direction? Should my blog be more like something else or less like another? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe what my life needs is a dramatic soundtrack.  One of my favourite events was the excursion out to Happy Canyon. My wine education has mostly geared me towards being interested in the wines themselves. Click on a random blog post and there’s a good chance that I’ll talk about the wine and not the people behind it – so getting to interact with people who actually get the juice into the bottle was really cool. James Conaway, one of the writers on the panel of wine writers, accentuated the importance of focussing on people from a wine journalist’s point of view. Come the second night, I didn’t realize that my late-night crew included Jon, winemaker of Hand of God wines. I was fortunate enough to try his wines before he had to jet off early, which was unfortunate. I also vaguely remembering all of us dancing to Get Lucky at some dive bar a couple blocks away from our respective hotels at 2AM.  A lot of people seemed to be irked by the panel of winemakers and the panel of wine writers. A lot of people made blog posts about how there wasn’t enough diversity on the panels, or in the case of the wine writers, not enough diversity in their respective communicative media, wine education, gender, and so on. At the same time, this really made me smile in the slightest, because perhaps it means that there’s so much more room for the global group of wine writers (and wine people in general) to grow. And I don’t mean to sound like an inspirational commercial that at one point has a picture of the earth and fancy string music, but there’s so much potential for unique voices to come forward in a community that according to Corbett Barr, hasn’t reached its golden age.

I’m pairing Katy Perry with sherry, out of all things.

The wine is interesting and hits notes somewhere in-between two wide styles: Fino sherry, embodying the fresh exciting savoury newness that induces hunger, and Oloroso sherry, which is the nutty and more oxidized blanket of sugarless caramel. This wine has some of that exciting Fino freshness, but it’s framed by an aged and nostalgic frame of grilled nuttiness. The parts of freshness and reminiscence both come together to make this interesting narrative of cool disjointedness, hence “The One That Got Away”. (That is, if you imagine that Katy Perry was mostly singing about protective yeast cells and Fino sherry.) This wine is a Palo Cortado-style wine, but has since lost the ability to carry the designation from the bit of sugar that it carries (from backsweetening). These wines start off as the flor-blanketed Fino (or destined to be an aged Amontillado), only to have the flor die in the process and have the partially-briny sherry become more oxidative and dark in character.

Complexities derived from the traditional method of sparkling wine add legitimate and intricate bready, yeasty, and biscuity tones, but the price usually (and personally, most importantly) doesn’t justify it for me. Cava is usually the answer to my complaint, with grapes that have naturally lower acidity, can derive some similar autolytic and rubbery notes with production, and I don’t have to dab my wallet with paper towels every time it begins to cry. Speaking of crying, here’s a picture of rich kids pouring Champagne all over their gold watches. WHY?!?!?!?!?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! YOUR PARENTS MUST BE SOOO PROUD Ahem.

Maybe I’m not used to more aged examples – or just better examples in general – of the style, because the wine seemed much more full-bodied and in the darker black cherry fruit range than I expected. Sure, there was that raspberry quality all the descriptions rave about, but the fruits seemed much more stewed and evolved to me, and there was less leafiness than I expected (which I guess is a good thing), enough to convince me to propose the possibility of a Côt, which is essentially Loire Malbec. That being said, I’ve heard a similar note from someone else about another one of his wines, so maybe it’s a stylistic thing.

Even though this was a semi-blind flight, even someone new to wine could instantly smell the grassiness that was a Sauvignon Blanc. It’s a trendy grape right now along with Pinot Grigio, leaving Chardonnay and Riesling in the background – couple this with summer, and it’s a grape that produces wines that can fly off the shelves. Sauvignon Blanc isn’t a “serious” grape. It hardly ever ages, its character is dominated by primary aromas, and much like Gewurztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc is both pronounced in its character and is usually unmistakeable in its aromas, but with more mouthwatering acidity than Gew. Although I preach its distinctiveness, it has a range of emotion, from the restrained gunflint versions in the Loire, the oaked versions in California, and the greenness more expressed as stewed bell pepper and jalapeño combined with lower acidity in areas like Chile. So we come across this wine, and despite the fact that the class can often be split on identifying wines, I would say that the majority of the class guessed that this was from New Zealand. Not Chile, we said: too lean, green, and bright. And not Sancerre, either: too fruity. A wine like this was from the New World, and from a cool climate at that. It was a bit of a surprise to find out that this was from none other than Sancerre. The searing acid makes much more sense here – New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is apparently softer in its structure. But the fruitiness is perhaps a response to consumers, who find that outward flamboyant style to be popular. Enter a modern style of Sancerre.

So yay, I suppose. The wine’s strengths lie in the finesse, elegance, and balance.  Though there is traditional-method complexity there, it’s something you really have to search for on the nose. The palate is a little more intense, and there is a round expression of mineral, tart red fruit, and some savoury biscuity flavours. Balance and elegance are a bit tougher with sparkling wines. There’s something about the interaction of bubbles, acidity, and intensity that are an unexpected challenge, and we don’t realize how important they are until a wine badly misses the mark on one of the criteria. Though this wine’s aromas shy away, the structure is rounded out by the dosage and savoury character on the palate.

It seems like everyone around me is getting post-holiday ailments but I’m doing my best to survive. The holidays were fun but thankfully, they’re never really over-the-top for me (besides last year’s Soave incident). I swatted all New Year’s Eve plans out of my view in favour for cooking myself a meal, drinking a bottle of wine, and sleeping at around midnight: and you’d think that would end up totally bumming me out, but I had a satisfying sleep as the planet fully rotated into 2015, and I woke up at a decent hour to do some wine reading. I’m riveting. I know. No hangover: that was a thing, though! I’m not the biggest fan of New Year’s resolutions, mostly because I don’t plan that far ahead, and because I think it’s weird to make weird and shallow decisions at some quasi-arbitrary time of the year. I tried to stop being an asshole in late August, and I mean – it didn’t work, but I also didn’t have to wait until January 1st, y’know? Plus, it’s not like I’m one to remember anything I superfluously claim at the beginning of the year, let alone most of the things I’ve done in 2014. I’ve looked through my calendar and journals, and holy shit: there were way too many things I did in 2014 that I can’t believe I don’t remember in a quick snap. But perhaps most of my instant memory is dedicated to remembering regions of Italy, or whatever. That being said, I can’t help but think about changes to make in 2015, and I did this whole sappy review-the-year sort of bit during the eve of 2o15. And it was great, really. At the risk of sounding like a shitty Hallmark card, I’m legitimately excited to see how 2015 will trump 2014. 2014 was truly a good vintage for the grapes of my soul. It’s dawned on me that the diploma exam is in 6 months, which will most certainly fly by quickly. It takes dedication and time to review material and blog about it every week, so I’ve decided to condense my posts instead of squeezing each bottle of wine onto its own page. It cracks my tepid heart in a stupid way, but hey: that’s life. January is the temporary calendrical haven for the retail person, but then the wine fest will roll around in February like there was nothing to rest on. Gotta take it chill. We come back to school this week in a class about Piemonte and Veneto. The instructors likely thought we needed a slap of acidity on the first week back just to wake us up from post-holiday doldrums, and so we did: we had two whites, the first which was a marzipan-scented Soave (Inama 2012 Soave Classico, $30) with creamy texture and intensity, appropriate to pair with a 90s slow jam; it led to the juicier and more lightweight Gavi (Fontanafredda 2012 Gavi, $26), which was more of a bright citrus dagger with flavours of lemon zest, apple skin, and lemon tea. We then had two flights of three: I completely blew the first flight, which were three different Valpolicellas that we had to judge in terms of quality: I thought the Amarone della Valpolicella was a Ripasso della Valpolicella; I thought the basic entry-level Valpolicella was a Dolcetto; and I thought that the last – which was the actual Ripasso della Valpolicella – was a Barbera d’Asti. Great. Perhaps my palate is off because both a classmate and I took notice of an intense acidity in the Amarone (Monte del Fra 2007 “Lena di Mizzo” Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, $80) that was apparently softer than we had perceived, though there was a lot of textbook dried fruit and chocolate character, all wrapped up in an evolved savoury and tarry leathery blanket. The basic Valpolicella (Masi 2013 “Bonacosta” Valpolicella Classico, $17) almost seemed off, with this sort of stinky decaying leaf sort of character but in a less charming way, and subdued black fruit and a lighter body also had relatively low intensity on the palate with tart fruit and a short finish. The actual Ripasso della Valpolicella (Musella 2011 Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso, $30) had a bit brighter acidity than I expected, with thunderous sour cherry, raspberry, and cranberry on the palate, which sounded like Barbera d’Asti to me, in theory. I thought that it needed, perhaps, slightly more concentration to balance the structure. Then again, I am just waking up. The second flight was much more straightforward, and we were told that each of the three wines were of different grapes but were from the same region: and so, deductively, it was easy to guess the Dolcetto as Dolcetto, the Barbera as Barbera, and the Nebbiolo as Nebbiolo. The first (Elio Grasso 2013 “Dei Grassi” Dolcetto d’Alba, $35) was an intense purple colour with plummy black fruit with bits of earth and an agreeable stemminess. All rather textbook on the palate with moderate acidity and chalky structure, with similar fruits on the palate and a slight lack in length. The Barbera (Ricossa 2012 Barbera D’Asti, $16) even vaguely reminded me of the wine in the previous flight that I thought was Barbera, with similar crunchy cranberry fruit and a fistful of acidity. Good value. My mouth is falling apart, at this point, and I can tell that the last wine belongs to the soul of a Nebbiolo, with aromas of forest floor, leather, dried red fruit, and wet leaves.

I took the advice of a classmate (also an ISG graduate) that I met during the Intro Court of Master Sommeliers course – apparently, the BCL has one Viognier from India that is fantastic value and is very varietally expressive – one which she tried during one of her ISG classes. Coupled with the fact that I’ve been craving heavy yet bright and fresh wines with sort of the Alsatian Riesling or German Weissburgunder sort of feel – I decided to go for it. And I know – Viognier isn’t any sort of bright and acidic grape, but I’m all for new and crazy shit. (Because while life is too short to not try an Indian Viognier, it’s also too long to try the Zind Humbrecht Pinot Blanc, which is actually mostly Auxerrois (damn it, Alsace!)). The wine shouts Viognier – sweet floral notes along with stone fruit and tropical fruit flavours yell typical for the grape variety, with a heady spiciness not veering too far from the likes of Alsatian Gewürztraminer or Muscat. And despite the voluptuous body and warming alcohol, the wine isn’t as flamboyant on the palate – the intensity shows a bit of restraint. The acidity isn’t fresh, but it’s there, and it’s enough to keep things balanced. Makes sense though – it’s Viognier. And of course, the typical slightly imbalanced phenolic bitterness that Viognier can have – common and hard to pull off. All in all, think Californian (or Australian) Viognier with a little more elegance. There is a lightness to the wine despite the viscosity – the balance isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough. I must be missing something – vineyards close to the water for moderated temperatures, high altitudes, or short-lived vines – because India has a strikingly hotter climate compared to the other winemaking regions on the planet, which can equate to vines that tire themselves out without the winter to build up carbohydrate reserves. Or, an interesting amount of alcoholic photoshop to the wine. Who knows. I’m interested, but I can’t find a spec sheet, or I’m too lazy to really try.

I’ve read a wine encyclopedia describing Saint-Estèphe as the “least sexy of the Médoc’s famous four communes”, and I suppose the description comes from its more northerly location and therefore a slightly more uptight profile, with higher acidity and more of a graze to its texture compared to the other communes.

Petite Sirah, a crossing between 1880 Peloursin and Syrah (also called Durif). I’ve never loved a wine that Petite Sirah has touched – it’s not unusual to find this in a jammy (and sometimes confected or even off-dry) Californian Red; more than a few examples have been enough to condition me away from it. How dangerous.  Courageous hipster grape evangelizers like Jennifer-Simonetti Bryan MW (who recommends the Bogle Petite Sirah in so many of her articles and interviews) always kept my mind open. To me, Petite Sirah is to Zinfandel and Syrah as Pinot Blanc is to Chardonnay and Pinot Gris – there are some common links, but the latter grape lives in the shadows and the good (and apparently sometimes long-lived, for Petite Sirah) examples of the grape can be tough to find in some markets – but they exist, and they are justifiably good. Back to the grape analogy – Petite Sirah has that baked fruit characteristic that you might find in a grape like Zinfandel, but can still have more structured mouthfeel which is more akin to Syrah. This wine is a good example of a sub-20 version: baked red and black fruit supported by vanilla and cloves. The palate echoes the flavours, but the structure might be deceiving for those who expect a texture as soft and easy as the jam flavours: instead, a large amount of ripe tannins and a well-balanced acidity structure out the wine, but the finish is a little imbalanced. There is a slight bitter attack and a bit of a persistence of such flavouring throughout, but it’s inoffensive and generally contributes to a rougher character.

I’m sure I passed but I don’t think I performed in an outstanding fashion, so I should probably stop coming up with excuses to “celebrate”. Oh well!

And yet, the grape still has a spectrum, even if a small one – the softer and friendlier Asti versions, to the darker, serious ones of the Alba – both areas in Piedmont. The only Barbera from Asti I’ve ever had has set the standard for all Barbera since then, and the dried, sweeter red fruit I expect is usually replaced by darker, smokier, and sometimes clunkier fruit that I always assume is more Alba-like in character. Hence the guess. This wine did have that “darkness” – black and sour cherries, spice, but a slight green herbal note which may have stemmed from a cooler, less ripe year for Piedmont. There was nothing overtly wrong with the wine – it was just simple and fresh. There was an interesting smoky darkness on the nose that someone thought may have stemmed from rot, but who knows?

Hurrah! I wanted to open something nice for my co-workers and I as an excuse. I bounced around between several bottles before settling on this dude. And then I realized how poor I am. Yay! The cork was horrifying. Upon lifting the foil at the top, we discovered that the cork almost had something like a mini-pool of wine at the top and was damp all throughout. With some effort we removed the cork properly without a hitch, and the golden liquid was free for us to taste. As expected, the nose is interesting and complex. Any fruit exists only as a ghost of citrus dominated by secondary and tertiary characteristics. Honey, wax, and butterscotch are all evident. There are also some weird aromas – weird in the sense that the aromas might be bizarre or even repulsive to the newcomer (like petrol notes in aged Riesling) but interesting to the wine nerd nonetheless. And by that, I mean we smelled cabbage and garbage water, but like, in a good way. There was also a flutter of a wet asphalt minerality – almost like fresh rain on a road. Ironic aromas reminiscent of fresh images, considering the age on this. Less graceful on the palate – the acidity was impressive, but almost unwoven, as per with the alcohol which seemed to slightly warm the back despite lower alcohol. Definitely powerful, concentrated, and round, with a bright citrus character dominating the palate. Slight sherry-like oxidative quality on the finish. Long length. What’s interesting is that they apparently experimented with this wine by ageing it in French oak for 18 months. This is definitely a nerd wine – I can see the regular consumer being interested in trying this, but be easily repulsed at the same time. This wine is also quite concentrated and powerful – not for the faint-hearted. If I had this by itself, I’d only be able to have one glass. Perhaps this calls for food, and my colleagues and I agreed that some sort of fatty smoked fish would work. Could this age? The developed characteristics tell me that even if it could, changes would be minute, and could very well veer into the depths of full oxidation. Though, the acidity and structure is definitely there, and Chateau Musar is known for creating long-lived wines, so it very well might be possible. My experience with Lebanese wines is extremely limited. Well, near non-existent, really.

While she explained that around 65 percent of people would say it was Chardonnay, the rest would say Riesling; the class was split in that sense, but I couldn’t raise my hand for either, and did this sort of I’m-not-sure-comme-ci-comme-ça hand motion. Ironically, both grapes are arguably rather out of fashion. Chardonnay is making a slow comeback, but Riesling has a reputation of being sweet. And it’s not always sweet. It’s not always sweet. NOT ALWAYS SWEET. not always sweet. Enter this wine: I’m slightly frustrated, because Austria did enter my mind, but the biased part of me that said “no, that can’t be because why would the instructor choose Austria?” instead made me choose a dry German version, which in retrospect, makes less sense. The wine was clunkier than the elegant “lime sorbet” (as described by the instructor) versions of the Mosel. The wine was bone dry with high acid and a concentration that I thought was worthy of a very good quality designation. But I was probably overrating this wine. Flavour-wise, the wine was a steely version which was citrus and mineral-driven, with hints of developing petrol characteristics. One classmate actually guessed this as Loire Chenin Blanc, which I thought was weird, but is apparently a common mixup with wines like these. I’m sure this could age even just for a couple of years, as it has the structure and hints of classic Riesling development.

I had thought this was more neutral at first – perhaps it needed to warm up. But the floral characteristic with spice and soft expressions of stone/tropical fruit would lead this to Viognier. After having tasted the German Pinot Blanc, I was so sure that this wasn’t Viognier. Texture-wise, this is a much more fresh expression to what I expected – Oz Clarke’s verbal paintings of voluptuous fruit and enticing creamy notes lead me to believe that the Pinot Blanc was Viognier. Washington is the one of the last places I would expect this from – a calmer more mineral tone lead me to believe that this was certainly a cooler climate (and perhaps even Old World), but it lacked a bit more flamboyance than I would expect, although there was more intensity on the nose and palate than I had originally noted. Suddenly Washington makes sense, but I hardly knew they grew Viognier there. Viognier is a grape quite known for its phenolic characteristics: an example of a grape that maybe needs more care in vinification opposed to its growing, due to a common bitterness that it might have. This makes sense. I’ve hardly come across many affordable Viogniers that I’ve fallen for. Condrieu is on the spit bucket list. Although less loud than I had expected, this style of Viognier reminds me of some of the Pays d’Oc versions I’ve had, but better. The less impressive restrained versions have had that imbalanced mineral savoury bitterness without much fruit and balance.

Tomorrow I’m sure I’ll find a dirty quarter on the ground, and it’ll be an excuse to open a beer. I bought this guy months and months ago while needlessly going on a wine shopping spree at some other store. It was the last bottle they had of it (I’m always a sucker for things like that), and it was somehow mentioned in Drops of God, which is a wine-themed manga I have yet to read. I’ve had this particular wine described to me as “liquid clay”, and I imagined this really cool fluid earthiness that would smell like crushed Gastown bricks on fresh Commercial Drive garden soil, coming together to make some sort of bottled East Van (though Parallel 49 has pretty much covered that in visual form) – the wine obviously has more fruit than I skeptically imagined.

The wine is a little light than I expected for an opulent year, or perhaps my expectations were simply in the wrong ballpark. But if I were to compare it to a wine I’ve had recently, it slightly resembles an aged Pomerol. The colour is starting to develop from the five years of age; the body is medium at most, and perhaps slightly below that. It’s also showing hints of development, with bits of leather showing against the mostly baked and dried plum-driven fruit. Subtle oak, though the back claims two years. I really like the intensity, here, and structure is also rather subtle. It’s definitely an early-maturing style: can’t develop a better kingdom if you don’t have the walls, so cash it in. Not sure what the blend is, but it’s most certainly Merlot-dominated, and the wine is produced from organically-grown grapes.

Besides a week full of plans, today is my designated day to be lazy and drink Sauvignon Blanc. The wine is as pretty and elegant as the label but perhaps not as colourful, although it’s  both easy and tough tasting Sauvignon Blanc because it’s so gettable: as a result it’s easy to spitball every single obvious Sauvignon characteristic onto a tasting note. In this case, though, we have a classic Loire Sauvignon Blanc – perhaps as a reply to the more modern Loire Sauvignon Blancs or Sancerres of the world – with a classic fruit-restrained nose, a much more expressive palate, and a seamlessly balanced acidity on the palate. A bit linear, though. Less complex wines can often be hard to justify at high price points, especially for the shy and elegant whites of the Loire. The beauty in delicate wines like these are the balance in acidity – the wine is quite bright and round at the same time; no component dares to sing over the other, and although I hate the word “finesse” (only because I don’t think that I truly understand it), this wine seems to have it. Delicate and subtle yet strong, like carbon-fibre. Oyster wine, raw or cooked and drenched with butter, tested and true. As tough as it is to describe: the minerality and acidity in the wine play with the brine and delicate body of the oyster, creating a lasting, refreshing, and satisfying combination. That being said, Sauvignon Blanc isn’t usually a grape I find too exciting. The first few sniffs and sips are awesome, but rarely has a bottle kept me sweaty and hot throughout. New World counterparts are a bit more exciting and flamboyant, but you buy Loire Sauvignon Blanc because you want Loire Sauvignon Blanc. The grape can rarely be an adventure, which is ironic considering the pronounced scents reminiscent of the outdoors. I don’t know.

After a long dry spell of wine stemming from a promised exam study session complete with delayed gratification, I decided to whip this guy off of my rack because New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is what you need when you have a white with an intense aroma profile. The nose was subdued at first but became more intense; what confused me was that it didn’t become more intense in its stereotypical NZ character. Floral and mineral were what I received off the nose, and any citrus was subdued and vague enough to not be specific. For me, at least. Intriguing, however, were the sauteed onion and honeyed spice notes I got off of a 12-dollar 2007 Chilean Sauv Blanc, except in a lighter secondary style. I don’t know what elderflower smells like so perhaps that’s what I’m getting. Texture-wise, it’s all textbook New World: rounder, slightly fuller body, lower acidity, but a flavour intensity that matched the nose: citrus and boring. I’ve had cheaper white Bordeaux that’s had more New World character than this. I’m usually a fan of atypicality, but this was slightly disappointing. Further blind tasting with my co-workers a day after confirmed my thoughts. They all thought it was an Old World wine. There was hubbub about chalkiness and even a final guess of Chablis or Chardonnay, followed by a discussion on possible malolactic fermentation. They were super surprised by the reveal, and the ones who’ve tasted this wine before or the same wine in a different vintage were sure that it tasted different. It was agreed that this had lower acidity than expected (I KNEW IT), which is weird for such a recent vintage. Bottle variation? Weird vintage? Improper storage? Did someone at the winery leave the bottle out in the sun for revenge? Was the bottle lying right next to the hottest part of the airplane? Did a hen think this was an egg? Oh, the stories!

So my unexpected 2-day weekend was met with a half-finished blog post, nothing, Project runway, more nothing, and a decision to open this Malbec. Because I was strong enough to not drink anything yesterday (up until that pisco + orange juice experiment) and because I feel like I haven’t truly relaxed for the past couple of days. Which is dangerous when that thought changes once you open a bottle of $40 wine in solitude. At first I was not impressed with the wine. Initial upfront fresh earthiness upon opening a wine always gives me paranoid thoughts of it being corked, but I let the wine open up and it delivered. On the nose, the Malbec is dominated with s spectrum of punchy fruit along with an earthiness and slight smokiness – the wine has been aged for 12 months in French oak so this is unsurprising. The peppery oakiness wraps around a prominent dark cherry, dark fruit, and slightly dried floral and raspberry character, opening up to hints of leather and dark chocolate. The deep fruit resides well with the earthy components, both being quite present. The palate is much more expressive than the nose, with vibrant and ripe fruit characteristics that echo the fruits on the palate. What’s interesting to me is that we expect a mouthful of viscous syrup with the whopping 14.5% (!!!) alcohol, but the wine retains some level of finesse without loss to concentration. Structure is on the medium side, which unwinds the knots on the deep fruit flavours and silky texture. Which is exactly what you want on a night when all you’re doing is wearing the same thing you were wearing 48 hours ago while having back to back Project Runway marathons. Because you can. The ripe fruit contrasts with the slight extracted-tasting bitter finish. Although this might seem like a championing excuse, I feel like this prevents the wine from being too cloying. The alcohol is well-balanced. I had to warm up to this Malbec. I was literally craving an overextracted viscous wine, but this demonstrated the difficult balance between ripe, warm-climate reds without over-sleazing the wine. I was undecided between “good” and “very good”, but I eventually landed on the former category, though on the higher side. Tall, dark, handsome, suave, flirty, foreign.

This is a producer that apparently was quite popular in the past, due to having less BC winery competition and perceived scarcity. I assume that they’re still doing well now, but not as good as before. I often get Chardonnay and Pinot Gris mixed up, but a little oak always screws me up.

Did you see Australian Grüner Veltliner coming? The answer is no. You didn’t. I mean yes – I tire my face out by tensing my eye sockets and resisting an eye roll every time someone says they “don’t like Australian wine”, which is somewhat fair considering that the market can be saturated with its own stereotypes. I suppose it’s just good business sense, but there’s so much potential past the generic back-of-the-bottle tasting notes that preach deep berry fruit, “smooth”, and an empty promise that it’ll pair well with barbecue. Bitch, please. But a handful of people raised their hand when the moderator for the event, Mark Davidson, asked the crowd if this was their first time tasting an Australian Pinot Noir. So it’s possible that everyone’s pretty happy where everything is and I’m just a combination of impatient and willing. And thirsty. So the theme is essentially anything weird or against the grain, whether it be international grapes grown on Australian soil or weird modern blends or whatever. Really attracted to the whole idea, and I think that this was the seminar I was actually looking the most forward to.  Not sure if it was the power of suggestion, but even after revisiting the Nepenthe 2014 Winemaker’s Selection Grüner Veltliner after having tasted all of the wines, there was an intense celery root and white pepper flavour underlying the leesy lemon curd. Arguably more typical for the grape than other wines I’ve seen from its regular home in Austria. I thought the slightly creamy body added complexity but it was mentioned how this was “accidental”, and that in future vintages they aim to make a fresher style made completely in stainless steel – there was some usage of (old?) oak barrels here that rounded out the more usual pointed character of Grün. The Tahbilk 2013 “The Tower” MVR is a 60-25-15 blend of Marsanne, Viognier, and Roussanne. A Dream of Spring, mostly, with creamiscle and gardens, and a bit of a nectarine yogurt thing bringing visions of an Activia commercial. The palate is rounded with some tang on the mid-palate. Fairy lights. The Grüner from the previous wine illustrated new wines that were produced from vines only planted not more than a decade ago, but this wine was chosen to show that even pioneering wineries are still trying to push the envelope. Madonna, or something. A woman in the crowd proclaimed that “that doesn’t exist anymore”, “that” being the irritating Anything But Chardonnay notion in the recent decade or so, as if the moderator had to issue some sort of a warning before people realized we were slated to taste a wine made from the terror-inducing Devil’s Grape. If only it didn’t exist, though – I still think a lot of people refuse to buy it like it has gluten – but the Shaw + Smith 2013 “M3” Chardonnay was fantastic, with a distinctively non-fruity nose that mostly brought to mind the burnt bits at the bottom of the microwave popcorn bag, with hints of spicy citrus zest and grilled pineapple. Fuller and creamy but with acid to balance out the scales, and much more savoury citrus on the palate. Just a splash of malolactic. Part of the panel discussed the much-used line that Chardonnay can do well anywhere, and that it’s actually just as finicky as Pinot. I’m inclined to debate, but I’m not a grape-grower, so I’ll shelve the thought and let it grow.  The Yering Station 2012 Village Pinot Noir from the Mornington Peninsula had aromas of ripe red fruit with bits of white pepper and pomegranate. Same fruits on the palate with more of a soft floral component. Perhaps too lightweight for me but agreeable and at least part-hedonistic. I’ve tasted the Abel’s Tempest 2012 Tasmania Pinot Noir before in class, but I’m much more charmed by it this time around for some reason. Much more complex than I remember, with lots of red fruit. The fruit is less ripe but more dried compared to the Yering, along with some spice, oak, and floral perfume. Someone I know equates Malbec to tasting like pen ink or new shirt dye and I definitely don’t blame him but now it’s all I can think about when I taste the damn grape. The Evans & Tate 2012 “Metricup Road” Malbec had this sort of inky asphalt entry with decaying leaves and asian spice along with blackberry skin and dust. For some reason it reminded me of a haunted house in the rain. Like mud and earth and dust and mysterious scrolls with fresh ink partially revealing clues to whoever murdered the blackberry merchant. I’m done. There’s this one butcher shop on my street around which I mentally create a no-go radius, because there’s this one particular spot that has a vent with these acrid meaty fumes coming out of it. I swear that there’s a hint of it in the Hardys 2012 “The Chronicles Butcher’s Gold” Shiraz Sangiovese (or is it just because I’m seeing the word “butcher”), but there’s also lots of dried herb and a dusty gravel sort of aroma that makes it more pleasurable. Lots of structure here, and quite drying. The Peter Lehmann 2012 “Layers Red” is part southern Rhône cocktail and part Spanish Tempranillo. Mostly black cherry, cola, spice, dried flowers, and literally, a bit of what my glass smells like after I’m finished with a particular oaken gin. A sort of sweet cinnamon-herb smoke? Tannic but finely textured, and a vague smattering of both red and black fruits on the palate.  I was mostly excited to try the next three because they seemed the most fucked up of the flight (besides the Grün, and okay – the Malbec). I was actually really impressed by the McGuigan 2013 “Shortlist” Barossa Valley Montepulciano – jellied but not jammy, if that makes sense? Lots of dark blueberry and hints of vanilla, dried herbs, and something animally. Quite structured at the end and some blood orange on the finish. A central Italian grape that I definitely don’t drink enough of. The Hesketh 2014 Barossa Valley Touriga had an interesting Viognier-like floral note of bergamot which was super cool. More spice, sweet black fruit, and some Froot Loops. Super structured like most things in the flight, and quite concentrated. Personally, the most exciting wine in the flight (and perhaps of the whole festival), and of course it’s not even available in our market. Yet. I haven’t seen this flavour expression from the Touriga-based wines of Portugal, from which the grape comes. High hopes for this one, for sure. I definitely love that the Tar & Roses 2013 Tempranillo is bizarre and complex but there was something I wasn’t completely into. There was lots of bold earth, raspberries, and tar, but there’s a hint of medicinal cherry syrup on the mouth that climbs through the chalky structure. I wrote down that it smells like someone’s house. I don’t get what I was trying to say. Of course Shiraz makes up the last wine in a seminar titled “Mod Oz”. What the fuck is so ~*mOd oZ*~ about Shiraz? The Longview Vineyard 2010 “The Piece” Shiraz is delicious, with hints of eucalyptus, cola, black fruit, and some soy and leather showing age without veering into total soy sauce territory. Pronounced chalky tannin and a fair amount of acidity join a viscous body, along with oxidized black fruit. 2 years of very well-woven French oak. If I remember correctly, the ~*mOd oZ fAcToR*~ comes into play because of the packaging which has a sort of street art Beastie Boys theme, and I remember hearing something about a sort of art competition they hold yearly for each vintage’s label. And a fascinating seminar concludes the wine fest.

I’m also supposed to be doing WSET Diploma exam preparation for the sparkling and fortified units which takes place in June – and this isn’t even a sparkling or fortified wine so I can’t even use that excuse, nor will I have the willing sobriety to even study after a good fifteen minutes of consuming even a bit of this wine. But I’m convincing myself that this is a nice excuse to study a bit of Pinot Meunier, the understudy of the three main grapes in Champagne. So there. The wine is whimsical in both theory and taste. Pinot Meunier is not a grape you typically see by itself in its lonesome blatant youthful character. In sparkling wines (e.g. Champagne), it mostly serves to contribute some form of youthful upfront fruit which isn’t really meant to age for super long periods, sort of like how casual Fridays attempt to make the workweek a little less austere, or how the drunk uncle might spice up a positively boring wedding. This rosé captures Pinot Meunier’s playful, soft, and unpretentious nature, displaying melodies of mostly strawberries, rhubarb, and some floral character. A hint of spritz on the palate. Pair with Oh Land’s “White Nights”, to which this wine would dance if it were a person. The wine almost veers into gummy bear territory, but the intensity of the flavours on the palate balance it out. I suppose the wine could have a bit more structure and finesse, but perhaps we would also lose its Seussian nature.

I can’t find myself to delete or change it because it’s a valid thought in my wine journey: can’t you see newcomers finding Saint-Émilion boring? Saint-Émilion is an appellation on the right bank of Bordeaux, where Merlot is king. Saint-Émilion and Pomerol are the well-known and most prestigious areas in the right bank, where Merlot arguably finds itself in its most concentrated form. As we would soon find out, Saint-Émilion is the gutsier wine of the two appellations, and is supposedly less obviously from the right bank than is Pomerol. This is easy to believe with the chalky texture, high acid, dark plum, dark berry fruit in this wine, along with the oak that largely expresses itself with dark chocolate. There is no Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine (but there is 20% Cabernet Franc), perhaps accounting for the supremely lush and almost full body, but despite hot alcohol and an almost-perfect finish, the wine is quite intricate and well-adjusted. There’s a bit of added robustness from this interesting metallic earthy iron clay note in this wine which I know may put off some, but it’s sewn quite well in this wine – and its apparently indicative of the region, which brought me to guess Saint-Émilion.

And then I had it in a restaurant forgetting that I had it in class before. And then I had it in class again – and I thought the wine was fantastic all three times. Besides the change from “Old Vines” to “Vieilles Vignes”, I’m stoked that my tasting notes were generally in the same camp. The first time around we were given 5 white wines to match with 5 different grape varieties so Chenin Blanc was basically a given, but this time around it was a little tougher. I mean, you smell heavy oak and baked apple on the nose with that identical echo on the palate, and you immediately think new world oaked Chardonnay. You just do. Even if you’re a super advanced taster and you knew it wasn’t new world oaked Chardonnay, the thought has to have at least crossed your mind. It’s like you see that one haughty scarf-wearing guy in the lineup one October when you’re in the line for Starbucks, and it’s like “this bitch is definitely going to order a Pumpkin Spice Latte and I bet he has an unforgivingly difficult hipster name for the barista to write on the cup”. And even if he orders a grande dark roast and his name is Tom, you’re like “I bet this bitch enjoys them anyways”. The South African style of Chenin Blanc tends towards the riper and powerful driven examples opposed to the tight Loire versions that can take years to open up. There’s almost a parallel with new world oaked Chardonnays and tight white Burgundy. And so I and whoever read their notes out for this definitely thought this was Chardonnay, but the key factor is the acid, something which Chenin Blanc is naturally high in. It’s a nice alternative to a Chardonnay that might be better for a versatile food pairing (Thanksgiving, hint hint), and you still get that meaty texture for a white and that baked apple character, but with a frame of acid that keeps it fresh. Speaking of Pumpkin Spice Lattes and Thanksgiving – this is a superb autumn wine which combines the weightier warmth in a cooler season and some cozy baking spice.

At first glance, there’s something eerie and almost disturbing about her. I thought the books would give me more insight on Effie, but it’s the other way around – they did a really good job of fleshing out her character in the films. Like Effie, Rosé Champagne is a cryptic pink in a sea of others. Rosé is hardly even mentioned during any levels of WSET, so Champagne versions are even more peculiar. I wonder if the dash of hue is generally viewed as more extravagant in some areas – or perhaps it’s generally viewed as unserious, much like the opinion of the champenois on these particular wines. The wine had a delicate nose of mineral, flint, dried red fruits, and hints to autolysis that were generally more expressive on the palate. The acid was soprano high yet balanced, and the flavours were long-lasting. I enjoyed it, but it was almost too delicate for my tasting. The phenolics of the red grape skins in rosé Champagnes apparently bind with molecules that contribute to autolytic character; therefore, such bready and toasty aromas are deactivated. This explains my confusion over the constant breadless traditonally-made rosé sparklings. It all makes sense now! I’m still intrigued.

It’s a polarizing grape at which wine drinkers subconsciously learn to either smile or shudder from the mention of its name (may the odds be ever in your favour), and the subsequent hilarious discord that it produces in the wine world makes me love it even more. The grape produces wines which aren’t strangers to levels of volatile acidity, which expresses itself with a pungency, sometimes in a vinegary or nail polish-y sort of way. The contradictory grape is great because it can express a cornucopia of non-fruity aromas but isn’t elegant about it like top-notch Savennières or aged Bordeaux, and instead it Harlem Shakes its way into your nasal cavity without giving a shit about what you think. Pinotage breaks rules. I’m not going to lie – I bought and opened the wine with the intention of likening it to Katniss Everdeen (the heroin to the Hunger Games trilogy, if you weren’t in the loop of LIFE) and it really does make sense. The ashy earthiness is reminiscent of the coal mines of District 12 and the arena of the annual deathly sport. Pinotage usually has a demurely vibrant character that mirrors the silent and present strength of Katniss, and this particular Pinotage has a heavy-handedness that doesn’t completely translate into being full-bodied and instead has a slight agile lightness and roundness. The tannins hide a bit of character in the mouth, and despite the expected full-bodied character, there almost seems to be a bit of a hollow midpalate. Though the wine has a bit of a typical medicinal character (that I will shamelessly and obviously compare to first-aid kits that the Hunger Games contestants might use), the wine has more of a deep fruitiness and less of an overt meaty character and loud ripe pungent sweet spice that I’ve seen in other examples of Pinotage – perhaps this is due to young age? This wine sort of opens up with that sort of character. I’m inexperienced with Pinotage. But the high and balanced alcohol is definitely fitting for The Girl On Fire. I’m currently reading the first book after seeing the first two movies in the series.

Just after tying up my Superman chucks and opening the door to jet out to the bus that’s almost at my bus stop, I see this huge package in my mailbox which I can only hope is my WSET Advanced-level books. And it is. So I snatch it and run for my bus. I dizzily flip through it and end up with some lack-of-sleep-early-morning-physical-extertion-motion-sickness nausea, but new books, or new reading material – new anything, for that matter, is too exciting to pass. </consumerism> I also accidentally knocked over a 12-bottle box of beer. Thankfully only one of the bottles broke. But yeah. Tuesdays are delivery days and so I happened to bring in some exciting physics to an otherwise decent day. Also bought a couple more beers to try (for extending my knowledge, of course…). The Samuel Smith’s Raspberry Fruit Ale is apparently good (I’ve only ever had the strawberry). Another colleague suggested two more beers which I shall try later. Anyways, I digress. Another colleague has once again chosen a wine for me to taste blind. Apparently it takes a while for the wine to open up, which I can understand – all I got at first were notes of basic red fruit, and vague spicy aromas of black pepper, cloves, and liquorice. Sour cherry notes are starting to appear, as well as this earthiness. I know I should let it open up more, but I can’t help but want to reveal this wine soon. It’s reminiscent of this BC Pinot Noir I had recently – that earthiness is coming through. What strikes me different are the notes of sour cherry, though. I’m going with either Pinot Noir, Grenache or perhaps something light like a Valpolicella. I’m thinking of risking a new world guess, although it’s hard to tell. I don’t know. It’s not too complex (but at the same time, it’s not boring and simple) – I wouldn’t price this higher than 25 dollars, and that’s already a stretch. I can tell that the quality is good though. Nothing sticks out. Good structure. Aha! Revealed. The Italian classic-looking label honestly made my heart drop, because I was really settled on the Grenache thing, but at least I considered a Valpolicella. The price though – the price is almost ridiculous, I think. I’m honestly not that impressed with it – but I’ll give it another chance to open up. I don’t know, though – maybe it’s because I recently went to a wine fair where I literally tasted around 50 Italian wines in a row. So maybe I’m subconsciously and temporarily numb to them. All in all, it was okay. Nothing special, although this was balanced and solid – I’ll give it that much. Edit: it turns out that a lot of people at work were really one-or-the-other about this wine. Literally half of my colleagues didn’t really enjoy it while the other half really liked it. And apparently the Ripasso method thing was supposed to throw me off. I guess it kinda did.

But yes – the whole ordeal was partial torture because there was a huge dominance in obvious homogeneity for heavier reds, and it becomes tough to evaluate wines when the only ones that stick out are the ones that are “different”. It’s easy to write something off as boring when it’s actually rather decent quality, so perhaps it’s safer to treat my tasting notes as a progressive story of me gently losing my mind rather than an actual set of viable records. It’s worth mentioning, though, that I highlighted some wines to retry the next day with a clearer mind and cleaner palate, because I felt like I needed to give some wines a second chance – and surprisingly enough, most of my thoughts seemed to be the same. Huge headache at the end of the 173 wines, not to mention the beer, cider, and spirits. And I know: spitters are quitters, but whatever. I couldn’t even enjoy a drink afterwards and had to gulp water until 1AM because I felt like a dehydrated piece of onion from a package of instant noodles. Favourites and stand-outs highlighted in a fun shade of blue.      Blue Mountain NV Gold Label Brut\nAll too fresh in my mind because one of their higher tiers was my last bottle of 2014. I subsequently fell asleep before midnight because I am a champion. Restrained intensity with bits of autolysis, and power.      Tantalus 2013 Riesling\nA bit more closed than I remember, but quite well-balanced. Always glad to be stabbed in the tongue by Tantalus daggers.     Thornhaven 2013 Gewurztraminer\nNot as aromatic or intense as past vintages? Maybe I’m crazy. Drier style of Gew; almost full-bodied with spice and lychee, but you already knew it would have spice and lychee because it’s Gew.     Domaine de Chaberton 2013 Reserve Bacchus\nRetried this and quite liked it: lots of that floral stone fruit, persimmon, peach candies, and a weird but forgettable hint of lipstick.              Blue Mountain 2013 Pinot Gris\nThe fruit shares the limelight with the oaky nuts. Creamy and well-balanced, like that one guy. Just kidding. Blue Mountain 2013 Pinot Blanc\nLighter than the Pinot Gris, but with good balance between stone fruit, texture, and itty bits of oak.   Domaine de Chaberton 2013 Reserve Pinot Gris\nPeaches, flowers, green apple, and there’s a bit more concentration and verve that a lot of the Pinot Gris in this flight don’t have.    Lake Breeze 2013 Pinot Blanc\nDistinctively all about the texture. Wins points for balance and texture rather than complexity. I love Lake Breeze and this is a fantastic wine, but some people masturbate to this and I kind of don’t fully get it, but then again every fourth drink I order at a bar is a Bellini so   Summerhill 2013 Small Lots Pinot Gris\nThe colour of onion skin. Applesauce, hints of starburst candy, and then a floral tea finish. Into it.   Fairview Cellars 2013 Sauvignon Blanc\nAn earthy and baked tangerine character, quite reminding me of the Sauvignon Blanc-dominated 2011 Puzelat-Bonhomme Cheverny from the Loire. I’m so France-y. You already know.  Mt. Boucherie 2011 Semillon\nStunningly only okay with its reception (???) but I thought it was an unintentional (and perhaps accidental) tribute to the style of Hunter Valley in Australia. Kind of impressed?            Poplar Grove 2011 Reserve Chardonnay\nSome complex tension on the nose. Does that make sense? Like, it’s not a basic bitchardonnay. Hints on malo on the palate and balanced. Township 7 2013 Chardonnay\nA fresh playful fruit bowl. Ahhhh!  Tantalus 2013 Chardonnay\nSuch fantastic traction between finesse and savoury character on the palate. Hints to something buttery, but it’s well contained.        Road 13 2012 Jackpot VRM\nSuperb creamy style with texture on the palate, and there’s also great tension that adds character. Quite generally well-received. Tyler Harlton 2013 By Hand White\nA bit of pear sweetness and a hint of spritz, like the first 5 seconds of a Katy Perry music video. Also quite well-received.        Quail’s Gate 2012 Pinot Noir\nLavish red fruit, strawberry; fragranced and a bit slutty.      Lake Breeze 2011 Seven Poplars Pinot Noir\nSomething pleasantly raspberry lambic-esque that’s sure to please some people. Maybe I’m just thirsty for beer.   Tantalus 2012 Pinot Noir\nRaspberry, black cherry, and hints of potpourri. A bit more melancholy and distraught for a Pinot. Quite intense tannins (for a Pinot) but much more graceful and polite than the Clone 93. Tantalus 2012 Clone 93 Pinot Noir\nSpicy, merry, and a little more extroverted than its older brother. This was more popular compared to the regular. Mt. Boucherie 2012 Family Reserve Gamay Noir\nRemember that time I made out with someone in a field of Gamay vines? I mean they weren’t Mt. Boucherie vines but I really hope that those grapes make a wine that ends up tasting something like this. Bae/10. Oak Bay Vineyards 2012 Gamay Noir\nBlooms with intensity on the palate, and very Beaujolais-like. Juicy and well-integrated, y’all. Stoneboat 2011 Pinotage\nSomething simultaneously dusty and ripe on the nose. Some kind of dried fruit, perhaps? Fruit-driven with raspberries and vanilla; appropriately intense and interesting. I like this, but I like almost all Pinotage, riot-scented or otherwise.    Time NV The Girls Red\nSpice, red fruit, and milk chocolate to match the plummy black fruit. Curvy and slightly hedonistic. Church & State 2010 Coyote Bowl Series Merlot\nA hint of agreeable greenness shows through the slowly-forming aged characteristics and ripe fruit.  Ex Nihilo 2010 Merlot\nShowing age but the wine isn’t super intense, and tannins are a tad tangled. Better as it opens up.  Painted Rock 2012 Merlot\nDeep and grapey with plums and vanilla, and a closed nose that reveals itself more on the palate. Reminds me of some modern oaked Navarra blends from Spain? Am I weird? Hester Creek 2012 Block 2 Reserve Merlot\nSmoked meat? I mean, totally bizarre for Merlot, and it wasn’t so popular with some people, but I thought it had much more balanced concentration than its barbecue sauced Cabernet Franc brother.  Poplar Grove 2010 Merlot\nSmoky fruit but restrained. Structure cockblocks the fruit – a bit tight but pleasurable.            Alderlea Vineyards 2010 Marechal Foch Clarinet\nGood balance between fruit and earth; hints of grapiness. A bit of sweetness on the palate that I’m not sure of but I suppose it’s pleasant.     Osoyoos Larose 2010 Le Grand Vin\nSpicy pasta sauce and meat. Bolognese-y and clearly showing some aged characteristics at this point but still tannic as. Church & State 2009 Quintessential\nShowing well for its age, with intensity booming on the palate. Much like the previous wine with less meat flavour. Drying finish. Clos Du Soleil 2012 Celestiale\nLushly textured and early maturing. Strong backbone.     Painted Rock 2013 Red Icon\nMalbec-dom. Oaky and soft with some drying tannins on the finish.   Poplar Grove 2009 Legacy\nA bit withdrawn on the nose but well-structured on the palate with pleasantly evolved characteristics. Like. Road 13 2011 Fifth Element\nRedcurrant, oak. A balanced hint of green pep.   Time 2011 Red Meritage\nHint BBQ, hint dried cherries, and a weird hint of church. So like, a church picnic, obviously.   Lake Breeze 2012 Meritage\nFirst vintage where Petit Verdot was used for this blend. Hint of meat and florals among the balanced soft juiciness.                Church & State 2011 Coyote Bowl Series Syrah\nBlack pepper, dried flowers, party on the palate. Delicious, and definitely more of a lightly bitchy style but in like a good way.  Moon Curser 2013 Syrah\nGrapey, juicy, lush, easy, and a little slutty. But good peppery depth. Painted Rock 2012 Syrah\nGamey, meaty, and kind of smells like my spice pantry, and more specifically, the powder in those Ichiban instant noodle things? Relatively light-footed on the palate.   Poplar Grove 2011 Syrah\nBroodingly concentrated on the nose, with a bit of restrained and flexed biceps on the finish. Good ripeness amongst the black pepper.     Elephant Island 2013 Framboise Fortified Wine\nHeady and delicious. My body is ready.

We’re handed our room keys as we get off of the bus, and the front desk worker stops me as I walk through the lobby. She specifically stops me asks if I’m Josh – I say yes, obviously, and I wonder whether or not it’s because she’s secretly an undercover agent, and that this is the beginning of some really exciting spy film where I would discover my undiscovered penchant for leaping off buildings and using my wine knowledge to save the world. God, I need water. I know she’s asking because there was some sort of logistical airplane snafu with my friend Kayla (who was also a scholarship recipient last year) which led to her having to get someone to drive her up to Geneva from Elmira. Thus, she missed Villa Bellangelo but beat me to our hotel room, and I couldn’t help but wonder how she described me to the front desk. The vaguely sober bald asian with glasses? The guy whose head looks like the inspiration behind the Minions of Despicable Me? We freshen up before our next winery visit; I decide my weird lumberjack shirt should be sufficient despite the fact that I see everyone else changing into evening dresses and platform shoes. I ask Kayla but she tells me to do me, so I do me. This was beautiful but I was squinting for the entire evening. We arrive at Ventosa, receive welcoming packages, and taste two different kinds of delicious local cider. I’m supremely fearful of dozing off at this point because I normally would, considering all this stimuli we’ve received so far, but I find myself engrossed in the current theme: Finger Lakes Women. Diversity. Looking back at the conference now, I’d say that this was definitely one of my favourite sessions, especially since a lack of diversity was a current criticism for both the previous year, and for the wine industry in general. They really went the full mile here, and even the cider and provided cheese were also crafted by women. We’re reminded that Seneca Falls, just a mere 15 minutes away, was huge for the birth for feminism in 1848. The speakers included Marti Macinski, owner and winemaker of Standing Stone Vineyards; Jenna Lavita, winemaker at Ventosa Vineyards; Erica Paolicelli, partner at Three Brothers Winery & Estates; Liz Leidenfrost, 3rd generation owner and winemaker at Leidenfrost vineyards; and Kathleen Deys, biochemist and grape geneticist. Amazing dinner was crafted by Heather Tompkins. Huzzah! THE STORIES! After a bit of a vineyard excursion, we went back for dinner with the panel participants. It was at this time I decided to stop taking notes and maybe swallow for once. Bad idea? Maybe. Nah. Me picking underripe grapes. After dinner, they unexpectedly open up the tasting room. It finally (?) feels like I’m dying and I can hardly take a proper tasting note, and instead I’m craving anything bubbly. Ventosa 2011 Lemberger (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $24\nBlack cherry, tobacco, dried herbs, lots of tomato leaf. Generous acid. Spinning head. This particular wine won the Governor’s Cup for best red wine at the 2015 New York Wine & Food Classic competition, despite encouragement that Jenna Lavita shouldn’t grow Lemberger, or something like that. Stony Lonesome Estate Reserve 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Finger Lakes, New York) $14\nWhite pepper and potpourri. Dry, round, spice, green apple. Where’s the water at? Standing Stone 2014 Dry Vidal (Finger Lakes, New York) $14\nThough I have tried (and liked) various Standing Stone wines throughout the conference, this is probably my least fave of theirs. Lovely white peach and orange blossom, but strangely boozy without much depth or concentration. Slight effervescence provides lift. Though my roommate decides to be the sane one and sleep back at the hotel, some of us head to Lake Drum brewing which is just a block or two away. The beautiful space is co-run by Jenna Lavita. What a superstar. I obviously head for the local weird shit. Give me Brett! Give me all of him! #YES Summary: darts with The Vineyard Trail and Christine; Dancing Queen; delicious beer; and raw vegetables. That is all you need to know. The next day we head to Anthony Road. Beautiful scenery, and rolling around in the grass. We’re indeed greeted with a glass of rosé, we have a tour of the vineyards and winemaking facilities, and then we taste two sets of wines: an unoaked Chardonnay against one that was fermented on skins, and then a dry Riesling against one that was fermented on its skins. A traditional Geisenheim clone of Riesling on a V. riparia x V. rupestris roostock, I think. Well, according to Google. Next: Fox Run. Anthony Road 2014 Cabernet Franc Rosé (Finger Lakes, New York) $18\nThe nose contains a hint of bubblegum among a blend of strawberry, cherry, and fresh herbs. Racy with nice red fruit intensity to balance the tart lemons. Good morning! Anthony Road 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes, New York) $17\nZippy but not sharp; a hint of butter? Yellow apple, and a hint of freshly cut grass. Maybe suffers from just a hint of SO2 that needs to blow off? Anthony Road 2014 Skin Ferment Chardonnay (Finger Lakes, New York) $? [unreleased]\nCompared to its naked counterpart, this version is softer on the nose, and then chewier, mellower, and rounder on the palate. Anthony Road 2014 Riesling Dry (Finger Lakes, New York) $18\nChalky. White flowers, most notably, with an intense spritz of elegantly fruity and gummy white peach on the palate.

In this case, the deep garnet wine gave notes of big black fruit, cola, mint, and eucalyptus, but there were also evolved notes of soy, leather, and coffee. Full-bodied and viscous, and surprisingly still fresh on the palate with distinct acidity and pronounced but fine tannins. The finish was slightly clunky, where there was a hint of a funky metallic thing going on, but overall I was quite pleased. One of my most memorable moments with Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon (well, my only perhaps) was during a weekly tasting as part of the FNH 330 (Wine Appreciation) course at UBC, years ago, where the professor had the TAs pour us a Cabernet Sauvignon. It was from Chile, purportedly, but I sent out some e-mails and found out that the professor had blended a Chilean Cab (“too oaky and lacking some fruit”) with a Coonawarra Cab (“too fruity and lacking some oak”). Barely forgivable, in my opinion, especially after another student said he smelt eucalyptus in his wine, and then was shot down by the TA, followed by light mocking from other students: but anyone who’s familiar with Coonawarra Cab knows that eucalyptus is a benchmark aroma. I understand that the prof wanted to find a pure expression of Cab, but I think that was a contrived and ridiculous method of doing it, especially for a product that’s so based in its origins. And damn, that one student had a pretty good nose. Ha. I’m not sure what the point of that story was, besides to point out a story that included Coonawarra Cab and maybe an excuse to complain about random things, but I did lead a guest lecture at UBC on wine in this past week, so I’ve done my counter-duty to get students excited about wine.

Or does it, because it’s 10PM on a Saturday and all I want to do is be boring and sleep. I’m an exciting 22-year-old. I had tried this exact wine for the first time just two days beforehand, and I remember it being fantastic. So fantastic, that I had to snag a bottle for my own to either revel in the newfound glory of a BC wine I might actually crave for once, and also to confirm and do a double-take just in case that moment might’ve been crazy and ephemeral. So I happened to grab a bottle of this after having drinks with old friends – and then beers happened – which was probably not so much of a good idea. I mostly remember drunkenly eating fish tacos, dipping fries in ketchup, and yelling at my best friend and then demanding selfies be taken. Cough. As an attempt to mirror the first time, I opened this closer to room temperature with just a slight chill. Upon viewing, I remember the wine being slightly darker in colour – though I’m not doubting the fact that the first bottle could have been a bit more oxidized (in a good way). I also remembered that the nose was much more – to put it crudely – interesting. Some facets still remain – there are aromas of juicy grapefruit, an herbal-floral character, and an underlying hint of honey and tangerine – but something tells me it was much more intense and honey-driven on the nose the first time around. Perhaps it was just outstanding compared to the other wines in the lineup. Or maybe I’m just horrendously tired? Who knows. The palate matches up much more correctly in my memory – there is a surprisingly intense opening of ripe and almost candied citrus and grapefruit, with juicy acidity and citrus rind flavours falling into a savoury and long dry finish. Impressively, there is a considerable amount of body which makes me marvel at the moderate 12.8% ABV, but this oddity is weirdly double-edged, and the back-palate ends up being quite boozy. That one friend you think doesn’t drink but ends up being the one doing the most shots during that one spring break? This wine. Also this wine: the knight of flowers, because floral and citrus characteristics aren’t often coupled (or thought to be coupled) with unctuousness or brawn. And also because I’m still hung up on the fact that there won’t be any Game of Thrones for a good year or so. The odes to the white Bordeaux blends are almost overdone yet robust versions are often underrated. I often crave the summery Sauvignon Blanc characteristics with the forbearing qualities of a peaty scotch or buttery Chardonnay by the fireplace (in this case – Semillon), and sometimes the heavier versions of white Bordeaux do just that.

You know, instead of doing homework. So, after, instead of going home from school like a good boy, I caved in on my own desires and stopped by a different branch of the private liquor store I work at. I ended up spending a ridiculous amount of time there, and left with 6 bottles even though I planned to maybe buy 1 or 2 at the most. I bought this one in particular because the workers (co-workers, technically) at the store were all curious about it. Why not take one for the team? I don’t deserve legitimate wine on a Wednesday night where I’ve done no real work. This wine is laughably bad. Seriously? If your wine ends up being a pale ruby colour, why even bother keeping “Cabernet Sauvignon” on the label? For marketing, of course, and some poor little consumer is going to buy this, thinking it’s legitimate Cab Sauv, while instead, it tastes like sugar water with a red crayon dipped in it. It has long length though, if “length” means “weird burning sensation at the back of your throat even though this is only 12.5% alcohol”. This is the kind of shit you could get hooked on if you were one of those kids who couldn’t wait until the cherry jello settled in the fridge and you couldn’t help but eat the malformed solid-liquid sugar hybrid. It’s not bad for an alcoholic drink – it’s just not proper Californian Cabernet Sauvignon. In fact, it’s legitimately the opposite of Cabernet Sauvignon, and, if you served this to me blind, I would’ve thought this was some Beaujolais Nouveau that would benefit from some chilling. In which case, I’d be glad that I bought this anyways, because the Bojo Novo was 10 bucks more (I’ve never had one…). So technically this is good. I think I’m going to chill this and pretend it’s Beaujolais Nouveau. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a large proportion (if not all) of carbonic maceration. Use this shit for sangria. Everything Wine posts some bullshit generic Cabernet Sauvignon blurb about it which is hilariously false, but I have a weird sense of relief knowing that the people who work there haven’t actually tried it. Although it’s cheap (for a wine sold in BC, that is), there are actually decent and more concentrated wines for 10 dollars. This just isn’t one of them. The motto on the front is: “Friendship. Laughter. Skinned knees. Badminton on the lawn. BBQs on the deck. At Cul-de-Sac Wine Company, we raise a glass to good neighbours and good wines.” If you bring this shit to my damn BBQ, there will be no laughing, you will no longer be my friend, and I will trip you in your stupid hipster sailor shorts so you very well will skin your damn knees.

Hmm. I can see it. Sauvignon Blanc + Semillon makes for an interesting blend in their dry forms. It makes sense that the honeyed, tropical, and flabby-when-ripe botrytized grape is freshened up by the fresh-flavoured grape, but in their still forms, it’s almost exactly what you’d expect: a girthed-up Sauvignon Blanc with more body and less intensity, replaced by the neutralizing honeyed and soft citrus of Semillon. To me, the first blends that come to mind exist in Bordeaux, Australia, and Chile – although I’m sure I’m missing many more regions. In Bordeaux, it’s a little more elegant – more structure, with fresh herb-like Sauvignon character; in Australia, fruity, young, and soft; and in Chile, a more stewed and heavier character, with the herb-y Bordeaux expressed as the greenness more reminiscent of green bell peppers further softened by the Semillon. And that’s exactly what this was – and easy-drinking, soft expression which probably has the least amount of obvious green Sauvignon character than you’d expect of the regions I’ve mentioned (at least to my experience, so far).

I sheepishly display my confusion and partial sophomoric knowledge on German wines here, in part because a lot of the German wines I come across are too expensive for me. I’ve also noticed that Riesling has been in a bit of a negative light to the regular consumer, and it’s all about the dry. Riesling is as out as much as Coco Rocha is in, and despite its food pairing versatility, people avoid it like the plague because they think it’ll be like juice. The university crowd likes this – I introduced Riesling to a group of university students and they went forth and spread their knowledge to their fellow brobots. Back on topic – the vintage. Among other 2011 German Riesling vintages (most notably the 2011 Selbach Riesling and the 2011 Rudolf Muller Riesling), I’ve noticed that these wines lack the aromaticity that I expect from Riesling. Perhaps I don’t drink enough Old World Riesling to truly understand the character in its European homeland. Here, we have a wine with a strength that lies in its elegance. Delicate aromas are vague at first, but reveal themselves as sweet (but not canned) yet restrained fruity characteristics with a flowery nose. A restrained minerality blankets the whole. But I’m really just trying to be poetic, here. It smells like high class fruity sugar water with some pebbles mixed in. The palate is light and has a brush of medium sweetness that jumps away by a rather unexpected modest amount of acidity and a solid amount of minerality that shines at the back of the tongue. The acidity is not as high as I expected but is present enough to barely negate the cloy. The length is average, and the little bit of tangy citrus spritz is reminiscent of an applause that doesn’t seem to reach its plateau. Elegant and unassuming, but I almost feel like there’s something missing, besides a slight lack in acidity. Ageing might be an interesting thing to play around with this wine because I feel like there are characteristics that need developing.

I was given shifty looks, as if the workers were definitely sure I was going to write “penis” 300 times all over the ballot. I didn’t, by the way.

So I’m going to drink this and pretend that it’s representative of the election or something. I’m currently refreshing a results page and watching this one particular Twitter page like a hawk. Is this what listening to hockey on the radio feels like? The wine is distinctly floral and full of savoury minerality, like a cross between a young Loire Chenin Blanc and an old world Viognier. The slightly weighty palate has exuberant peaches and slices of citrus that are blanketed by stones and flowers, evolving into a walnut pastry sort of finish.

La Monacesca is highlighted in Jancis Robinson’s Wine Grapes as a producer for the appellation (and more specifically for the Mirum label), and it’s something I have yet to try, along with the DOCG Riserva versions of the stated appellations.

"description": "The nose is quite rustic: almost in an oxidative Spanish kind of way. I also get some vegetal mushroom or black olive character going on, which is reminiscent of some Negroamaro or even some French Syrah that I’ve had. So far, very atypical. A dominant dried cherry note even reminds me of Sangiovese, and I can’t decide whether or not this wine would be best marketed towards wine-savvy customers who are used to a rustic style despite lack of a vintage or Protected Geographical Indication, or towards those who want a fruity-earthy bridge wine, for the same problem. That being said, this wine is a lot more earthy than I expected. The palate is light but not entirely Pinot-silky. A bit of rusticity roughens up the wine with light yet chunky tannins and a savoury back-palate. A stewed fruit character also appears. The wine does not leave the palate without a hitch, and a soft footprint of warmth is left before entirely finishing. In a blind tasting, I would definitely have guessed this as either Spanish or Italian before French. Although adding complexity, I’m wondering if that oxidized character was a lucky mistake stemming from sloppy winemaking (e.g. not careful with oxidation). That being said, this is a non-vintage blend; at best, I’d be surprised to see if this was a solera-style still red wine (yes, they exist!).

There was a hint of something tropical or ripe – peach? Mango? Not particularly exuberant enough for me to really match it up.

Best most expensive game ever. Woot woot. And it also gives them a chance to try a wine they don’t really want to pay for. So everyone wins. Sort of. Initially, I saw that the wine that was picked was this beautiful deep lemon – beautiful only because everything I’ve seen lately has been boring pale lemon wines with boring noses to boot. What struck me next was the interesting nose – overripe apples (or what my colleague called “bruised”) were what I noticed first, with this super intriguing undertone of oxidized nuttiness that was almost sherry-like in character. We also detected a touch of honey, and my colleague also noticed some notes of fennel except I have no idea what fennel smells like so I just nodded. The ripe nose instantly made me think of a Spätlese, and the honey almost made me think of something late harvest-y that I had before (a colleague from another job even compared it to a Tokaji), but the palate made me think otherwise. Pretty much everything about the mouthfeel threw me off my initial suspicions. I did guess (correctly) the Old World at first, and then Germany (which was wrong). She hinted to me that the wine was from France. Then, she said that I was right having guessed that it was from the Loire. I then correctly guessed that it was Vouvray, and subsequently I rejoiced. Yes! Friday night success!!! The acidity was just strong enough to keep it in balance, although I could tell that it was going. I’m both afraid and curious to see what would happen to the already ripe flavours and slight oxidized nose with some more age – that, and the acidity. I’d just say to drink it now, silly. I’ve only ever had few Vouvray wines in the past, all of ranging qualities, but I’ve noticed that all of them having this sort of “teasing” quality, whether it be from the nose or the sweetness – and not that sort of “bad teasing” quality either, where sometimes you feel a wine straddles the line between several identities and doesn’t fully commit to a character – but instead, makes this intrigue an identity in itself (or maybe I’m just bullshitting). That being said: if this wine were a person, it would be Cersei Lannister. Oh God, yes. It’s perfect. I guessed a 30 dollar wine, but it’s really 42. It’s a strange and intriguing wine worth trying if you have the bones, but I’m sure there are other sort-of-just-as-complex Vouvray wines that don’t break the bank. I think.

A clear, almost colourless wine. I wasn’t sure whether or not the hint of peachiness in the wine was due to the red stains in the wine glasses we were using or because of some strangely coloured grape. Like Gewurztraminer. The nose was weird. I captured little to no fruit – just an ethanol-like spice, a slight neutral vanilla fruitiness, and neutral wood. Further smelling revealed a flutter of apples and more notably, nuts. Vague floral notes. Not aromatic. A generally restrained character, and I determined that it was Old World – no doubt that this wouldn’t be from the realm of the New. Two colleagues guessed Chenin – notes of wet wool and river stones were mentioned. Grüner, is that you? Maybe. Not enough acidity or life. Grüner is like that talkative friend. This wine is pretty closed. Similar on the palate: restrained yet round, but not oily. A mineral and a subtle tongue-coating citrus pith flavour almost cancels out the medium acidity, but isn’t cloying because there’s not much to cloy, except a slight alcohol warmth. The alcohol is not low. By no means did this wine seem anything that fit the diverse French moulds, nor the aromatic whites of Spain and Germany. Despite the lack in crispness, Italy seemed to be the one, with the all-neutral everything. Apparently correct. Looking back at my grape chart, guesses of Fiano or Falanghina (whatever the hell that is) probably would’ve been the closest (due to mere descriptions). My guesses started with Arneis, then trailed on to Vermentino, Verdicchio, Pinot Grigio, Trebbiano, and then from there I attempted to just name all the white Italian grapes I knew. Chardonnay-like, even. Who’d’ve thunk that this would be a Sangiovese (a red grape) without the red?! Crazy. Nerdy, even. Weird, especially because red Sangiovese typically has an undeniable aromatic savoury cherry character. Skins are important! Push down those grape skins. Pump them over. Oh, yes. It’s funny, because I always jokingly guess white Sangiovese whenever I’m blinded with a white, but this is the one time it took me forever to get it. I’ve had this wine be described to me before: memorable descriptions of red fruit have me believe that this wine is at it’s peak or over the hill (or that the taster might’ve been primed to pick up red fruit). If I was blindfolded, I’m pretty sure it would’ve been hard for me to guess the colour of the wine. In this wine, secondary characteristics reign! If this wine isn’t weird to you, it should be. Sangiovese without the red is sort of like a hot dog without the bun, a pizza without tomato sauce, or a college party without alcohol. Doable. Tricky. Atypical. Interesting? Absolutamento. Worth it?

Combine that with an area with a beautiful region plus an interesting history, and you have me sold. I’m going to halt my shitty speech of romance here partly because I want to sip more of this wine and partly because I should do some studying before it goes all to my head. But yes – the climactic uniqueness of Alsace, partly due to the Vosges mountains, results in constant sun, lower rainfall, and a cool climate. Grapes are therefore relatively more reliably ripe here – and despite the light-bodied reputation of certain grapes, fuller-bodied yet equally-as-bright versions of Riesling can be found here. Along with the minimum treatment of wine and the decision to hold back malolactic fermentation in most Alsatian wines, I would argue that most wine here is about distinct grape character and fruit purity. (What kills me is that Pinot Blanc is often given the shaft and is blended with Auxerrois, still being labelled only by the former, despite great examples that it can make.) I am not a big Pinot Gris/Grigio fan, partly because it usually doesn’t excite me, and partly because the fans who overrate the grape remind me of fans who overrate Justin Bieber. But unlike Justin Bieber, this is an example of a wine whose grapes have had time to mature on the vine, resulting in phenolic ripeness and high levels of sugar, though acid levels are slightly lower as a result. This is Pinot Gris. Pinot Grigio retains more of a lighter-bodied zip by being picked earlier, much to the detriment of the undeveloped flavours. This is a beautiful wine. Stone and citrus fruits dominate the nose, with a noted mineral and musky character. The palate is expressive and ripe, while filling the mid-palate with honey, ripe citrus rind, and stone fruit, then ending with a very long and savoury finish.

My tasting notes will probably be a little more tight and specific compared to a year and a half ago, and I’m slightly scared to see how different my tasting notes will be. I’m glad there’s no time limit or fear of reading out this time around. The wine is as close to itself as I can remember. Compared to other Cava I’ve tried, there is a less fruity and more elegant lightness to it. Fruits are a bit hard to determine on the nose, but there is a marked yeastiness – perhaps not as marked as I remember. There is a hint of butter stemming from what I’m guessing is either MLF or the addition of Chardonnay. The only qualm I have with the wine is its structure – thankfully enough that was the same issue that was brought up when we tasted it in class a year ago. Ironically I sometimes enjoy a sparkling with a lower acidity since the bubbles already add a refreshing character, but the slight lack in structure gives it a bit of a knockdown in terms of objective quality. It’s a bit of a tradeoff, because it’s a bit more complex than some other Cava in the price range. It’s a mellow but slightly more complex basic sparkler – it’s that one quiet person at that house party who doesn’t get as drunk as everyone else does and you end up having an intelligent conversation with them but you can’t really tell because you’re, well, drunk.", "price": "$ 22", "abv": "11.5%", "vintage": "NV", "color": "N/A", "overall": "Good quality: the non-fruity character of this Cava gives way to slightly more complex hints of bread and butter with a balanced character.

So if I could drink at work, I would definitely pair this with the moments where I don’t notice a customer staring at me while I’m dancing and half-singing. I’m shameless, and the best customers join me. Like this song! I’m sometimes a bit harsh with Prosecco, because it’s difficult when you detect that bit of sugar in sweeter versions. You then have to align and map the sweetness along with the obvious Prosecco-ness against the acidity, concentration, and other flavours while determining the quality. I underestimated both the Prosecco we had weeks ago along with this one. This is the second-ever wine I’ve had from Adami and it was an example of a fantastic off-dry Prosecco. Though I prefer Adami’s Extra Dry for better balance, the producer as a whole makes fantastic examples of higher-quality Prosecco. There was a bit of a discussion where it’s generally accepted that Prosecco will almost never be prodigiously complex, and we find that it’s almost always dominated mostly by its green apple and ripe pear fruit, complemented by the mineral tones and other fruits at its best. So at the top, where the best Prosecchi battle, we not only judge them by their small edges of complexity, but mostly – I find – by mouthfeel, balance, and concentration. And it’s tough.

Maybe I dreamed that it was so dramatic. But it’s for poor ol’ Madeira, so I’ll take it. Madeira is known for being quite unique and “indestructible” in a sense that it’s intentionally heated and oxidized. As a result, it can have a similar oxidized nuttiness like Sherry does. Unlike Sherry, though, Madeira has much more acid on the palate, which is something that I should have taken into consideration during the blind flight. Learning curve. The nose had distinct oxidized notes of almonds, cola, and soy. It’s a weird combination that blends together well, and there’s an interesting hint of dried citrus along with some spice and leather. As if Madeira and Sherry weren’t already sort of similar, there are subsections of each which will make it even more difficult during blind flights, but then I wonder if anyone who’s allergic to nuts gets a mini-heart attack every time they smell a Sherry or Madeira. This particular Madeira is made from Tinta Negra Mole, which sort of acts like a mimic to the “noble” Madeira varieties, named: Sercial, Verdelho, Bual, and Malmsey. It’s sort of like the pawn that reaches the end of the chess board. Because it’s still damn good. This marks the first Madeira tasting of this unit. Huzzah!

You’d think that semen from a god of wine would be something of the d’Yquem Sauternes level of things, but the vibe of Australian stickies are the pure and liquid hedonism that they bring as opposed to the complex and almost reverie-provoking elegance of top Sauternes, the latter which you usually need to patiently age, anyways. Where Sauternes can boast stone fruit, ginger, and honey, wines like these rodomontade scenes of brown sugar, dried fruit, and raisins. Okay – it doesn’t sound hedonistic in words, but you’ve really got to try it before you think otherwise. On another fluid-related note, one of my friends tried a Trockenbeerenauslese at the Vancouver Wine Festival and likened the texture to semen. I’m just going to go ahead arrest this train of thought and talk about this Muscat some more. The palate was luscious and full-bodied. The palate had a little more acid than I expected, especially for something Muscat-based. But part of the process with Rutherglen Muscats is that the grapes are allowed to dry on the vine which not only concentrates sugars but concentrates acid.

For some reason I was not tired after The Night Of No Sleep. My body knew. On a rainy morning dodging puddles and people, Christine, Amy, Leeanne, Sujinder and I bussed up to Elmira from NYC. This of course involved a cryptic and boisterous man who sat behind our group and modified the intensity of his New York accent depending on who he was talking to on the phone, including Joey, which included a mild conversation about picking up sodas at the dollar store; and then Beryl, to whom he aggressively told to check her mailbox and to “not worry about it” (severed hand?!). Obviously the world knew our NYC experience wasn’t over yet, and we’ve accomplished a lot before anything officially #WBC15. Anyways, we then rented a car straight up to Hammondsport, not before visiting Forge Cellars at the Hector Wine Company. So it began: this was our first flight of wines in the sub-AVA of Seneca Lake in the Finger Lakes AVA! Though my mind was excited like a child (or me) on his way to the ice cream store, I was physically exhausted and maybe fell asleep in the car in only minute-long intervals in fear that I would inadvertently create the best picture of our travels. Pictured: Sujinder judging me We tasted through the wines of Hector Wine Company along with wines of Forge Cellars, which is essentially a collaboration between Rick Rainey; Justin Boyette, winemaker at Hector; and Louis Barruol, vigneron of Chateau Saint Combe in Gigondas, located in the Rhône Valley of France. And so we arrived and legs were stretched. Hurrah. Justin Boyette Hector 2014 Pinot Gris, $18\nGreat: my first tasting note of a New York wine and I have to decipher this particular hieroglyphic tasting note. Aged in neutral French oak. A handful of white flowers and honey; savoury with a hint of herbaceousness (and a hint of something I can’t read). Soft and medium-bodied. Hector 2014 Sauvignon Blanc, $18\nA bit of nettle underlying satsuma, passionfruit, and guava. More of a supple tropical bend rather than herbaceous and high-pitched; overcast instead of sunny. Hector 2013 Dry Riesling, $18\nSteely and restrained nose, with lemons, honey, and peaches. Dry and not as jagged on the palate as I expected, with soothing moderate intensity. Forge 2013 “Classique” Riesling, $24?\nLarge proportion fermented and aged in barrels of varying ages. Something cracker or yeast-like which I’ve noticed in few other Rieslings. Elegant limeade with something meaty or defiant. Focused lime zest on the palate with a pleasant bitter-acid fruit finish, like a margarita without any sugar. Forge 2013 “Les Alliés” Riesling, $26\nFermented and aged in neutral barrels. Stands up straighter than the Classique. Dry; petrol, citrus, and a hint of cooked grapefruit. A bit of oxidized tangerine on the palate with zesty acidity. Hector 2014 Riesling Semi-Dry, $16\nFresh sweeter stone fruit on the nose; off-dry sheen on the palate with flighty and almost effervescent peach and pit with cleansing acidity. Juicy and chuggable. Hector 2013 Gewurztraminer, $20\nA ringing burst of spice, apricots, and dried flowers. A hint of sweetness emerges like a Diglett poking its head out from the ground, and this grades into a blanket of savouriness and an impressive amount of acid for the grape. Long and rosy. Forge 2013 Rosé\nPinot Noir. Pale pink. Floral strawberries and cream. Humble rather than arrogant on the palate, with a play between fruit and earth. Concentrated. Closer to the side of round rather than refreshing. Forge 2013 “Les Alliés” Pinot Noir\nVery pale ruby. Huge fan of the aromatic nose, but maybe I’m just a huge fan of smoke, game, and meat. Time will disentangle the palate’s rigidity. This one split our group in half, and everyone knows I love when that happens. Hector 2013 Essence, $25\nEqual parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot. Also equal parts American, French, and Hungarian oak. Slightly charred plums and chocolate; medium-bodied and silky with sparkles of ripeness. Fair amount of chalky structure to contain the fruit. Well-made but not as individualistic as the whites; muscular with a silky man bun. We left satisfied, but it was clearly time to deflate for a bit into our motel rooms. Though we snacked on two salads, evening sustenance was a 2 minute walk away at The Village Tavern. I missed vegetables and even though I eat meat, I ordered the menu item named “Vegan Adventure” though clearly the name was the most obvious red flag: it was basically stir fry, thin rice noodles saltier than the tears of a thousand mermaids, and a random hedged-bet garnish of pickled ginger and wasabi. Oh: is this the general “asian food” that every wine critic promises will pair divinely with every Gewürztraminer? When in Rome, Josh. When in Rome! #burgerregret But really: everyone else’s food was apparently amazing – and probably no one orders the Vegan Adventure to the point where they probably had to run outside immediately after my order to go and pick the carrots out of the ground – but otherwise, the wine list was absolutely divine, with no shortage of interesting varieties and back vintages of New York wines and otherwise. I almost chose a New York Rkatsiteli from my birth year (1992) for the table but decided that it might not be refreshing enough for our temporarily ragged souls. I regret it. In lieu of dessert, we borrowed a knife from the restaurant so that Leeann could teach Amy and Christine how to saber the bottles of sparkle we picked up on the way; we then we enjoyed those plus the same funky Prosecco from a previous night and a Crémant de Bourgogne around the fire pit next to our living quarters, whose owner (Don? Ron? Shawn? Fawn?) joined us as we had conversations about the film ratings of our lives. I say that I’m PG, but I mean this whole trip is changing everything, no? Regardless, this amazing evening full of vibes and connections is an ending to an episode with credits rolling and Wonderwall playing in the background. And the music abruptly stops as it cuts to a scene of next morning, where everyone is swimming in the lake or going for a jog or something and I obviously tangle up in sheets instead.  Clos des Vignes du Maynes “Ste Geneviève” Crémant de Bourgogne Extra Brut (Burgundy, France)\nNutty green apple, cider, and apple pie on the nose, with some precise acidity and doughy toast on the palate.

I guess my nose descriptor of “nut dust” is a bit of a stretch, but at the time it seemed appropriate though I didn’t read that out loud for obvious reasons. Amontillado is essentially an aged Fino, which, from the blanched salted almond sort of baseline, gradually moves into the grilled or burnt almond sort of range. So you get a bit of a nuttier sherry than Fino without relinquishing the savoury brine characteristics. Typically dry stuff, though some Amontillado can be backsweetened with sweeter wine. Though I believe that stuff isn’t allowed to be called “Amontillado” anymore (i.e., that Alvear Medium Dry stuff which used to be called Amontillado). This shared some characteristics to the first wine in the flight, which was a Palo Cortado – while that one had a gorgeous grilled nut nose that wrapped around a small gem of briny salt, this Amontillado seemed just as expressive but a bit louder in its Fino-esque characteristics. I remember there being much more apparent brine aromas – there were some notes of “olive” reported by some classmates. There was also a bit more of a doughy almond pastry note along with a hint of a caramel-like aged brandy note.

Not in an overtly negative way, of course, but just as part of its personality: the wine did have a good level of intensity and concentration, even though some complexity and length was left to the imagination. For old world Pinot, I find that there can be that difficult balance between being elegant and being watery. There’s a bit of a parallel in warmer regions, where you don’t want to amp up the volume too much, since excessive ripeness can take over Pinot’s elegance.

But she was one of the first things that came to mind when I was trying to come up with something or someone that resembled the fluid and seamless character of this sweet and heady wine, while also having some form of direct intensity. It’s sort of like liquid velvet. It’s a curvy and seductive wine. The wine is fortified Grenache, so, much like the previous wine in our flight, the wine’s process of fermentation had been halted by the fun addition of grape spirit which left it sweet, sort of like when I take several shots of vodka and end up being fun. The joke’s on you, sucka! The aromas are quite pronounced and they easily glide up the nasal cavity to reveal flavours of chocolate, chocolate-covered cherries, black cherries, and a distinct flavour of raspberries and black forest cake. The palate is similar, but there’s a bit more acid than I expect from something Grenache-based (and definitely unlike the fortified Muscat we had previous to this one) which gives it a bit of teasing structure.

And here I am reviewing wine, because number 1: I am crazy, and number 2: I miss wine. I miss wine. I won’t in a couple months, where I’ll probably be missing spirits. The Stump Jump is d’Arenberg’s entry-level white blend. I’ve heard wonderful things about the red blend equivalent (a Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre) and I’m a huge fan of their other wines, so I decided to give this one a go. This year’s blend is 72% Riesling, 11% Marsanne, 9% Sauvignon Blanc, and 8% Roussanne. This is drastically different from the previous year’s (2010) vintage, which was 28% Riesling, 27% Sauvignon Blanc, 25% Marsanne, and 20% Roussanne. According to a previous label, it looks like the grapes from the previous vintage also included grapes from Adelaide Hills along with McLaren Vale; this vintage solely has grapes from the latter. I find this interesting – perhaps the Stump Jump is made for a rather good quality blend without trying to be consistent in terms of their flavour profile. Perhaps the non-Riesling grapes didn’t survive, or perhaps they’re trying something different. Maybe they knew I would obsess and did it on purpose to laugh at me. Who knows! The wine definitely speaks to its Riesling-dominance in its dry Australian form. Direct citrus notes support subtle pithy peach notes, and a bit of floral character and a balanced minerality add some complexity. Before knowing the blend proportions, I swear I had caught just a touch of a greenness from Sauvignon Blanc – but maybe that’s just the power of suggestion. The wine is not overtly complex, but I don’t think that’s what wine aims to be. The subtle complexity that is there, though, reminds me of a ray of sunshine on a cold autumn morning – not super loud or intense, but subtle and sort of pretty. As the wine warms up it’s becoming louder on the palate without giving way to a lower acidity.

Plus I’m kind of annoyed and I want to douse my soul in good wine. I also didn’t drink anything yesterday, so that’s another excuse. I want pure fruit framed with some sort of structure, and Alsace is usually good for providing that. Being the sunniest area of France, it’s no surprise that grapes ripen easily but retain acidity from being in such a northern climate. Fruity but not flabby, flashy without being slutty, etc. I open the bottle and it’s not 100% what I’m expecting – the nose has a med+ intensity, but the fruit seems either faded or tight. It’s hard to tell from a grape that’s supposed to be drunk as soon as possible (i.e. within two years of the vintage for dry Alsatian Muscat) but is listed on the producer’s website to be enjoyed from 2012-2022. It’s dry but not oily like Gewurztraminer (a grape that its often compared to and sometimes confused with in blind tastings) and instead has a strong runway of savouriness that carries on to the finish. Seems to be an intended style according to the winery’s tasting notes. They’re right – it surely does finish more like a Riesling rather than Muscat, but I’m surprised considering the other Muscat I’ve had from them. According to the website – it seems like the wine from this particular area is done in a more elegant and spritzy style. That being said, drink this at room temperature (as I’m doing now) if you want to emphasize varietal character. I’m enjoying it much more in this state. It seems irritatingly uptight for a higher-priced Muscat and lacks the heady grapey quality that brings the grape to fame. Maybe it’s too old. Maybe it’s corked and I don’t know it. All I know is that I wasn’t transported to a field of ripe peaches, flowers, and unicorns when I stuck my nose into the glass. Like, it’s maybe Glinda the Good Witch territory, but definitely not anything past that. It’s good, but perhaps too stony and elegant for my deflated mood.

So on some last Tuesday of some sort, we were supposed to have practice (I love referring to practice blind tasting sessions as such because it sounds like I’m vaguely into sports) but it was cancelled because there’s a bit of a cold going around. The viruses have decided disregard me over the past few months so I’m lucky, and that’s saying something when you’re in retail because you’re basically touching everyone. I’ll get it at the worst time, I’m sure. That one birthday when I invited my friends over but was wrapped up in a blanket the whole time. I hopped onto the 2015 Vancouver Wine Festival tickets slightly more ravenously than I did for Lady Gaga concert tickets last year, even though I’m not supremely stoked that Australia is the theme country. Don’t get me wrong – I absolutely love Australia, but part of me fears that each seminar will leave my mouth feeling stained and used. I suppose I’m doing myself a disservice by expecting exactly what everyone else is thinking, but I guess that’s why there are all the cool seminars having to do with exploring different terroirs, and weird varietals grown in Australia and other cool shit. I’m into it. According to my credit card. Led a blind tasting with my colleague at UBC the other day. Daunted by the purported amount of people attending on the Facebook event, it was bittersweet to find out that not as many people showed up (because it’s cool to say you’re going and then not go or whatever). It was fun though: we featured four wines and had flavour elements laid out everywhere throughout the art gallery, having people match up flavours to the wines. We also did this last-minute thing where we had people write collective tasting notes on this big sheet of paper (which was really just the back of an old 2014 Decanter calendar). Success, I think. Also, cool art and stuff.    INVASIVE! It’s “berry” good. The right people came to this. Also, my best friend was there <3 And somewhere on the weekend I went to a friend‘s place for dinner after work. We had rice bowls. And I enjoyed it. Because rice. And bowls. And good cooking. And meeting new people. And laughter. And pomegranates. There was both beer and wine, but I decided to go right for the wine, being the pretentious fuck that I am, and the Anselmi San Vincenzo provided just enough light for that bridge between work and, well, anything but. (Does sucking in your gut count as work?) Then there was the Brokenwood 2006 IRL Reserve Sémillon, which, hello. Pikachu: lightweight, lithe, chewing on electricity. There was the Vereinigte Hospitien 1990 “Sanctus Jacobus” Graacher Domprobst Riesling Auslese which I made people taste blindly, because I am a monster that likes to ruin the rhythm of a good evening. Like a clogged toilet.  Charcoal filter, cheese, spice, sunsets. Tasting notes, not an insane grocery list. We finished with this weird non-vintaged beauty that smelled of Christmas and applesauce. The Jean Bourdy Galant des Abbesses is a gentle beast from Jura, and it’s made from must that’s been charged with herbs and spices, then fortified with marc de Jura. Swoon. Class was decent. We had 6 wines instead of 7 because of time (we still went 15 minutes over anyways), but also thank god because tannin galore. Central Italy has some powerful and dagger-like reds, and it’s almost like they need the refreshing, neutral, and almost bland white wines to balance out the superlatives. Meh. Though the first of our whites (Fontaleoni 2013 Vernacchia di San Gimignano, $18) was a little more characterful than the blander second (Ruffino 2013 Orvieto Classico, $13), it was argued that the Vernacchia was perhaps just slightly more oxidized than it should be, but hey: it added character. The reds are where it got more interesting: we were told that we would be given four reds from the same region, and it was up to us to determine which region and what wines they were. (Tuscany, obviously.) Awkwardly enough, I thought the most expensive wine in the flight (Gianni Brunelli “Le Chiuse di Sotto” Brunello di Montalcino, $99) was the one of the least best quality: it seemed the lightest in body, but perhaps the better description is that it was the most elegant of the flight. Guessed it as a Chianti Classico that lacked a bit of concentration and complexity, but I’m often prey to the gustatory equivalents of optical illusions. I suck. The second wine (Viticcio 2010 Chianti Classico Riserva, $40) was markedly floral and dominated with Sangiovese on paper, but the expression was much more modern and dark in its fruit. Lots of dusty violet character along with plums, black cherries, and very-well integrated oak. There’s a much more viscous mouthfeel and slight shortfall of poise, an outfit which I found similar to the third red (Poliziano 2010 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, $40), though I found flavours here much more textbook Sangiovese: sour cherry, dried red fruit, sage, and tomato leaf. I originally guessed that this one was the Brunello, but that was before I realized I had gotten the first two wines wrong. I changed my conclusion as I was reading out my tasting note, and I villainously beamed when the instructor said I nailed the wine, but I’m a Sangio-phony. Ohhhh! The last was the wine with that obvious cassis bend (Tenuta San Guido 2011 “Guidalberto” Toscana, $60), heavily suggesting something with Cab. Probably the most brooding and bearish of the four red wines, and the fullest body but perhaps tight in the slightest. Lots of opulence on the nose: spice, menthol, plum, dried black cherry, cassis, and a hint of game. My wine girlfriend is coming to visit on Monday for her birthday.

Hence the whole Margaery Tyrell sort of thing and the eternal sun that Highgarden seems to be in. I’m sure this would be their house sparkling wine if such a dumb idea from my mind existed. Also I apologize if you understood none of that – just more Game of Thrones junk (not junk) and I’m sure you’ve had your share. The nitty gritty details: the wine once retailed at around the high 20s or low 30s range, disappeared off the market for a bit, and then came back at a mere 18 bones (the agency is perhaps blowing them out? Too old, or?) so I knew I had to snag a few. I bought two, but the first bottle declined to sparkle and I subsequently wondered if I was an asshole for returning the bottle for another one. Probably. I’ve got a streak going and I gotta live up to it, anyways – I don’t want to be a good person and start all these rumours about it. Ugh. So, a similar thing happened to a friend of mine, who drank the wine anyways – because it literally is like a sparkling version of Clare Valley Riesling – floral, citrus, flecks of petrol (perhaps an artificial reference to poison? Hm?!). The palate is like sparkling lemonade sans the sugar along with wine-twists of mineral, floral character, suggestions to tropical fruit, and a soft lemon rind bitterness. It’s spring with a twist. It’s a pretty wine, and I want to gay it up and throw a flower petal into my glass (Loras Tyrell, is that you?). There’s quite a backbone of acidity but it’s well-balanced. This wine has spent 18 months on the lees, i.e. the dead yeast cells from second fermentation. Riesling isn’t a grape that typically undergoes such a process because it’s known for its opulent fruitiness, and any yeast or resulting bread flavours would only mask its natural intense persona.

This was the wine for which I had to read out my tasting notes. I’m getting better at confirming my notes and not being a nervous wreck when reading them out loud – and much to my surprise, it turns out that my set of notes was good and mostly true to the wine. And so I was happy! The only thing I didn’t do was come up with a country that this was from. Not enough girth to be Alsatian, nor crisp and neutral to be the style done up as (or done down as) Pinot Grigio. The ones I’ve had from BC have been more obvious in oak (perhaps this isn’t a generalization), and so I was undecided. And it’s weird, because I don’t remember ever having a Pinot Gris so overt in its stone fruit notes. The wine was softer and lower in its acidity, but didn’t hide behind the forms of oak and insipid neutral character that I’m used to. It’s very interesting how a relatively inexpensive bottle can be so informative. Pinot Gris isn’t as popular as Pinot Grigio, but it’s still pretty popular. The former tends to be fuller bodied, spicy, and more concentrated; the latter is usually picked early to retain acidity in exchange for not having ripened its phenolic characteristics. But both grapes tend to straddle the middle parts of the scale – arguably, they hardly reach the low or high scale of anything, including their intensity – they’re safe, pleasantly-sounding grapes, and my classmate cleverly named it the “baby bear’s oatmeal of the wine world”. This wine in particular is somewhere in between the full Alsatian style and the lighter, more neutral fruit-driven ones of Italy. So, a good example. Pinot Grigio is eye roll-inducing, but it’s definitely worth exploring the Gris side of this Pinot. I’ve had stunning examples from Alsace – the fuller-bodied concentrated examples are nothing to shake a stick at; I’ve seen interesting examples from BC as well. Sometimes I feel like I judge the Grigio too much – there is a reason why its likeable, but I wish people would stretch their horizons.

There were a couple of costumes here and there but nothing too wild. Which was great! I find Halloween @ UBC to be such a pooper, though, because no one dresses up – and even though I sort of hate Halloween, it kinda sucks when you’re all up in the Halloween spirit and end up embarrassed because you’re the only one in a 200-person lecture that decided to dress up. BUT – it sort of works if you’re dressed up as Waldo. Two years in a row. Shh. I made a friend last year by dressing up as Waldo. She still calls me Waldo. So the wine I was blinded with today was quite solid and delicious. At first, the nose was quite smoky in that delicate sense, without overpowering too much of the fruit. Now – although I’ve had a lot of wines (l0l), I still have trouble telling the difference between certain descriptions like oak and spice, but I was pretty sure there was some level of oak in this wine (which I found out later was Slovenian, which I’m not particularly familiar with). The fruit was subdued at first, and opened up after we let it sit for a while. There were some obvious cherry notes, with a bit of bright strawberry and vanilla, like what you get from red fruit roll-ups or fruit-to-go. The smokiness on the nose almost drew me to something Syrah-like, but the palate revealed otherwise. Definitely Old World on the nose. The palate was quite expressive (i.e. the opposite of tight). I found the smoky nose almost disjointed (or unexpected, rather, since I haven’t had much Barbera) with the relatively light body and tannin, and higher acidity. What stuck out to me, along with the beautifully integrated acidity, was the savoury peppery finish, and I was almost tempted to guess Spain, but Italy was where I eventually landed, and was correct. The Barbera grape was my final (and correct!) guess. Botched the year though. Guessed ’06 and beyond backwards, but finally guessed ’09 after like seven guesses. I got too excited. That being said – this was great. I haven’t had much Barbera – but I can say with confidence that this is a good wine. Quite expressive, and I would even age this, but not for very long (1-3 years?). Quite elegant. The acidity is well-integrated. I think this is just a small stretch for its price (I guessed 25-30 dollars), and I would expect just a touch more complexity, but that’s a small flaw. Barbera is one of the few grapes I remember from class: typically low in tannin, high in acidity, and the affinity for (Slovenian) oak.

Combine that with what Erin and I decided to drink the night prior, which was all of Cava, fresh hop beer, and bourbon. Why?! But the morning turned out fine, and we had shitty mimosas and beer at the airport to satisfy the unending ghosts of the night prior. The short layover in Montreal slowly eased us into our French-speaking modes, followed by a decent 7-hour flight to Paris. I sheepishly told the flight attendant that I would like the chicken option for dinner, which really just means I muttered “poulet”. I don’t remember what in-flight movie I saw, but after watching the trailer, I realized this might not be the time to finally watch Taken. Everyone always has one of these shitty interchangeable airplane wing pictures when they fly so here’s mine. Obviously filtered the shit out of it. Earlier in the year, when we decided to do this Europe wine trip on a whim, Erin and I had two stipulations when it came to deciding where we would travel: Bordeaux made us shrug, and Paris made our shoulders touch our earlobes. But the thought of separating Paris from our first trip to France was difficult, so we would attempt to take silly pictures with the Eiffel Tower and maybe watch tourists spend half an hour trying to get a perfect picture fingering the Louvre. Plus, our Canadian friend Theran currently lived in Paris, anyways, and he would be joining us for the bulk of the trip. So it was decided, and I took it as a sign when our first experience on Paris transit involved shitty (but admittedly entertaining) rap at 10AM which was more than any of the three of us could handle. oui As much as Paris ignited a forced montage and soundtrack (feat. Carly Rae Jepsen) of I-can’t-believe-we’re-actually-here realness, the first day was a jaded blur, starting with an awkward check-in at our hostel and then settling into our triple bunk, where Erin took the very top while I claimed the bottom. This was followed by a quick visit to the Cathédral Notre-Dame, a bit of a tour of the surrounding area, dinner at The Great Canadian Pub (yes: in retrospect, WHY?!), and wasting my travel data on Tinder. And so we slept like babies for the night. Our roommate had an odd combination of intentionally ripped shirts and early 2000’s cargo pants which really didn’t prepare us for the gentle distracting sounds that he provided during the night. I still think he just had a really bad itch, but Erin swears otherwise. Anyways, after some conversation (the next day, obviously), we found out that he was from Italy. And he really liked Bounty chocolate bars. Literally don’t know where this was but it was pretty soooo yeah I hate to be the guy that raves about the ~bEsT cRoIsSaNtS~ in France, but we legit had some good flaky warm ones the next morning and shared pastries next to some body of water that flowed through the city. We explored some streets and areas mostly to soak in vibe, and we also had a stupid aim of finding something to buy in Paris just so we could irritatingly tell people that we bought it in Paris. Then we ended up at Le Tout Monde, a natural wine bar which, annoyingly, we fell in love with. At first, Google Maps told us we had arrived even though it was a dark sketchy empty intersection after crossing a bridge, though weirdly, the surrounding streets seemed much more lively after the hours we had spent at the bar. All of the amazing and weird. We attempted to take tasting notes, but they eventually descended into haikus, and then single words, and then drunken aggressive conversations with Frenchmen. Matteo Furlani “Sur Lie Alpino” (Vino da Tavola?, Italy)\nGrapes of Pavana, Vernaccia, Lagarino Bianco, Verderbara: I hope this is accurate, and it makes me nervous that I can’t even find this last grape in the big Wine Grapes tome. Ancestral Method, if my research is correct, with no sulphites added. Hint of bruised apple and lots of white pepper and rosemary on the nose and earthy farmyard, but very open-knit and with a skein of apple skin and soil on the palate. Pétillant but quite textured. Not super long but with a ghost of minerality. Svelte and pleasantly slippery for a sparkling. Oh! Of course it’s sur lie, which explains the mouthfeel. Les Vignes du Mortier 2014? “Brain de Folie” (Vin de France?, France)\nUnsure of the vintage one this one, but I would bet on 2014 from research. Either Grolleau or Cab Franc (both?): my research is inconclusive because I can only find info on the red, but I swear this was a rosé. Rustic strawberries with a kick of well-woven herbaceousness (leaning towards Cab Franc but IDK you guys). Weighty and perfumed, with an echo of green pepper and strawberries on the palate. Rounded acid. More like a superlight red than a delicate rosé. Selene 2014 Beaujolais Nouveau (Beaujolais, France)\nRaspberry balsamic – lambic, even. Brett. Fresh palate, with even more evidence of something Cantillon-esque, with sprightly bits of sparkle, earth, and playful red fruit. Gentle but present structure. Château Lestignac 2014 “Tolrem” (Vin de France, France)\nMerlot. Brett, soil, plums, dark chocolate, dried herbs. Ripe blackberries, blueberries, and lush, like a warm blanket with an odd eclectic pattern. Chalky tannins and a bit hot, but amazingly complex and strange. Mas d’Agalis “Yo No Puedo Más XIII” (Vin de France, France)\nSyrah (50%), Carignan (40%), Mourvèdre (10%). Languedoc. Traditionally not allowed to state a vintage (though Vin de France is allowed now), hence the sneaky “XIII” on the label indicating 2013. Soil, blackberry skin, oregano, and meat. Ripe fruit and chalky structure. Simultaneously velvety and bumpy, and finishes tarry and ashy. This translates to something like “I can’t anymore”, but I’m pretending it means “I can’t even”. Yannick Pelletier “L’Oiselet” (Vin de France, France)\nLooks like past vintages have been vintage-dated, but the bottle we enjoyed seemed to be devoid of any specific year; same thing with a designation of Saint-Chinian. Hard to source down the grapes for this bottle but a faint internet grasp shows it’s probably based on Grenache, Cinsaut, and Carignan. A different sort of meatiness. Tea leaves and the vague description of Asian spice. Meaty green onions and dark fruits. Kinda cool and a ripe herbaceousness but strange and almost too weird: deserves time to be enjoyed, I think, instead of us taking on so many of these cool idiosyncratic wines at once. Cushy, intoxicating, ballsy, and fiery. Yannick Pelletier “l’de Rien” (purportedly Saint-Chinian, France, but that wouldn’t make sense if it was practically all Terret Blanc, would it?) [magnum]\nOxidized dream. Sip.\nOptic orange and nutty.\nSinks under the tongue. A tasting haiku whose matching wine identity escapes me:\n– “Brown sugar and prunes.\nBitter-sweet, raspberry leaf.\nAll oceans have shores.” I might not have even written this last one. All oceans have shores. Anyway, I go through this cycle of being enamoured with natural wines and then questioning the whole thing, but Le Tout Monde amongst other recent things have certainly nudged me towards the former, fermenting the desire for such places back home. Pun intended, always. Cue the next morning: our mothers would kill us if we didn’t take pictures with the Eiffel tower, so we did, albeit with a bit of a hangover. Check out this amazing cloud at this random place in Paris lol After discovering that the Champs-Élysées was not some sort of garden (as we had somehow convinced ourselves because we’re stupid), we explored the famous street anyway and I bought my one fabulously floral Parisian shirt about which I could shamelessly brag. Except it was from H&M, which means you could literally buy it almost anywhere in the world. Whatever though because I bought it in Paris. We visited the whimsical Ma Cave Fleury, which mainly served wines of the biodynamic Champagne house, Fleury, but they also served bottles of wine with similar organic or natural philosophies (e.g. Puzelat-Bonhomme!). It also happened to be something like “grass days” on the street, so there was astroturf everywhere, including long lawn chairs in front of Ma Cave Fleury, where we obviously decided to sit. If we’re gonna be sipping Champagne, we might as well do it on the most perfect thrones. Flight of organic and biodynamic Champagne, including a 100% Pinot Blanc! Fleury NV Champagne Brut Nature (Champagne, France)\nA blend of the 2006 and 2007, if I remember correctly. Beautiful gold-tinged colour, with lots of lemony citrus and red apple, sea salt, brioche, and butterscotch. Dry with delicate mousse and plenty of austerity giving way to more butterscotch. Interesting nutty centre amongst the lustre. Fleury NV “Notes Blanches” Champagne (Champagne, France)\n100% Pinot Blanc: yes. This is the weird shit I live for. Not super aromatic, but some red apple, a bit of nuttiness, yeast, and white flowers amongst the mineral. A little abrasive and hollow on the scale of Champagne, but with an apple juice-like accessibility and an earthy resolution. Fleury 2002 Champagne Extra Brut (Champagne, France)\nNot super extroverted and even slightly clenched. More doughy sweetness on the palate; sugar-dusted charms with soil and mineral. Definitely a combination of nutty, fleshy, and long. Lots to play with on the palate, here. Fleury NV Champagne Rosé de Saignée Brut (Champagne, France)\nDusty florals, cranberry, and earth amongst the elegant red fruit, which becomes much more explosive on the palate with more dried strawberries. Love! Erin and I obviously made the right choice splurging on Fleury before seeing Lady Gaga a few years ago. I don’t remember if those apples were fake or not. We passed out for a couple of hours back at our hostel (“…5 more minutes…”) before visiting the Montmartre, catching the tail-end spectacle of the Richmond Nightmarket-esque shops and the concert at the top of the hill. We were there mostly to get to Le Grand 8, a fantastic restaurant featuring organic and natural wines, which was suggested back at Ma Cave Fleury. We met some Texans who were discussing something about the appropriateness of one of their particular Instagram posts, and then we met Germans who talked about being German, or something. I don’t remember. We left early the next morning for the Angers, in the Loire. One city done; four to go!

This is one of those rosés where if you had this out of a black glass, it would be tough to guess the colour. For me, at least. The nose has a distinct and specific mineral nose of rainwater – that sort of rainy humid smell just before a cloudburst. Restrained on the fruit, basically. The palate is quite the opposite. Intense and ripe flavours display themselves on the tongue and despite the small amount of residual sugar, this would still be classified as dry. A zingy acidity gently appears, and a subtle shadow of a savoury streak makes itself present. Any food that this calls for must be delicate, as this wine isn’t very strong or intense. I’m not entirely sure I get much rosé character out of this than I do white.

In other words, it’s the wine that begins the descent into the most tortuous unit of the whole shindig. The first sip has sealed the deal and I feel like I’ve sold my soul to the devil. What have I done?! Sauvignon Blanc is such a gettable grape that it almost freaks me out that it didn’t come to me on the first sniff. Simple minerals and citrus, I thought, so this must be a run-of-the-mill white bread Pinot Grigio from Italy. Luckily the two other white wines in the flight were distinct – from the baked apple and oaky glass of the second, to the soft floral lychee of the third – so when I came back to the first wine the typical greenness was a little more evident. Sauvignon Blanc was a shoe-in, and the high acid suddenly made more sense. But where from? The austerity and muted nose deflected the new world from my conclusion: if anything, France seemed to be the only logical choice given that it’s the only classic old world region that grows this grape. But New Zealand wasn’t completely out of my grasp since this I’ve been involved with such trickery before. I eventually landed a guess of some entry-level Loire Sauv Blanc, but apparently this was one from the more southerly Bordeaux, and I suppose this makes sense given the slightly heavier and creamier body.

Much of the acidity seemed quite low to me at first, from what I suspect was from a lack of natural tartaric acid and instead, a front-mouth slightly artificial malic acid that was added to combat flabbiness. I didn’t catch it as much as other people did, but there was a slight funk on the finish which was suspected to be due to partial berry rot.

A bit of a contrast to the last wine in the flight which was the quintessential apple and pear-dominated Prosecco. This, on the other hand, had a marked mineral quality which sung more guitar arpeggios than guitar power chords. Further sniffs led me to conclude that it was undeniably very Chenin Blanc. It reminded me of a young and dry Savennières I had just the previous day, where the nose was all mushroom and wet wool with maybe some citrus, quince, and other pomaceous fruit in the background. Waaaaay into the background. This is definitely not your fruit-driven sparkling, and not even your autolysis-driven traditional sparkling.

That being said, Muscat de Beaumes de Venise – which is essentially partially fermented Muscat whose journey in conversion from sugar to alcohol has been interrupted by grape spirit and is therefore sweet – is similar to Prosecco in the sense that you’re mostly going to run into styles that belong to the “good quality” designation.

sparkling red that is Lambrusco. I remember having an entire bottle one holiday (Thanksgiving 2011? 2012? Christmas?). I retried the same bottle during a Youtube proposal video marathon and hair-dyeing session (not mine, obviously) with a close friend one night, only to realize I drank an entire bottle of corked wine on that one previous holiday. I thought the style of that particular bottle was simply lower in fruit and weirdly high and imbalanced on the “earth” aspect, but I missed all the glittery raspberry jam goodness that pairs nicely with weird yet charming dance mobs. And hair dye. I’m sure I would’ve finished the bottle had I known, anyways. I’m sure beer was also involved, but it’s hard to remember these things – I vaguely remember spilling a basket of mail and coins down a flight of stairs. I’m clumsy when I’m sober, so you can imagine the shit that stirs when I ruin the chemical equilibrium in my bloodstream. This particular Lambrusco had deep and dark berry jam notes, with hints of dark chocolate, earth, cassis, and weirdly enough – apple (reminding me of some Marechal Foch I’ve had. Maybe malic acid notes?). The palate was similar, with a surprising amount of acid to balance the ripe dark fruit, along with a delicate mousse. This wine is a bit of a trickster, and I was led to believe that it was heavier than it actually was. Thus I guessed sparkling Shiraz like a doofus. I enjoy disjointedly enigmatic yet playfully non-serious wines like this. Dark tones contrast with the light-footed fizz and bright acid.

That being said, what’s in the market for whites can roughly be split into two camps: there are the more honeyed and oaked white Bordeaux where Sauvignon Blanc lays integrated within the tropical butterscotch, and then there are the modern blends dominated with Sauvignon Blanc which seem like responses to the popular gaudy styles from the new world. This wine lays deliciously in the former checkbox. The wine is most definitely oaked, but without the buttery texture of a white Burgundy – it has upfront butterscotch and toasted coconut notes, but fruit is much more tropical and honeyed, and acidity is still on the high end. Not much of the grassiness of the Sauvignon Blanc like you would get from the Loire or New Zealand, but its vivacity is still there. Though this comes from the more southerly region of Bordeaux in Pessac-Léognan, a section of Graves, most white Bordeaux comes from the Entre-Deux-Mers region (which is my kind of EDM). Some fantastic blends do some from other areas of Bordeaux, but the caveat is that they’re only allowed to be designated under the big umbrella of Bordeaux AOC, but then again if you’re a huge profitable house that only A-list celebrities can afford, maybe you deserve that.

And the pinkness makes it more interesting. And yes – I do admit that the differences between this and the Crémant were almost indistinguishable unless you *really* stuck your nose in there and got a real sense of the characters of the wines – but perhaps the non-vintageness of the wine was at fault. I *do* admit that this wine wins in terms of the complexity. The yeastiness is barely above a notch in intensity, but the riper fruit matches the liveliness and effervescence of a rosé Champagne. I also did note the higher intensity on the palate, which was nicer. The bubbles were more aggressive, but the temperature of the bottles may have been wonky.

We’re virtually halfway for sessions this unit, and I feel like I haven’t even studied anything yet. Today’s sparkling-centric class mainly concerned the vineyard, where the main topics included grape varieties and vinification. Fun stuff. The cue cards have begun, and learning which diseases that each grape is susceptible to is sort of fun in a stupid way. We tasted a Californian blanc de noirs, a vintage Champagne, a Riesling Deutscher Sekt, a Cava with a large proportion of Chardonnay, a Cava with very little Chardonnay, and a sparkling Vouvray (this one was corked). Analyzing sparkling wine is evidently becoming a little more tricky than analyzing still wines. Differences can be super subtle, and there’s so much more texture going on. You have to pay attention to the bubbles before the liquid goes flat in the glass, and the alcohol is generally always on the lower side of the spectrum – so you have to train yourself to taste the holistic difference between a sparkling wine with 12% abv, 12.5% abv, or 13% abv, because those small stair steps could reveal the difference between an Old World and New World sparkler. Hence my confusion with the first wine we tasted. Practicing is going to be so expensive. Do I have to spit out everything? Life since the last week’s class has been pretty swell. There’s this city-wide festival that takes place during a couple of weeks this time of year called Dine Out Vancouver (hence the accelerated amounts of sometimes-annoying food pictures on Facebook), and so a couple of friends and I went to Whet on Granville Island which was cool. I retried the latest vintage of the wine that spurred me on to – well – wine (Burrowing Owl Syrah), and I think it was still good. But my memories of such things oozed out of my head from trying my best not to giggle at our server, who endured our half-joking conversation about creating a real-life Hunger Games. And because we aren’t a homogeneously alcohol-guzzling group, our improvised post-dinner plans involved us going to Chapters, where there was no shortage of us coming up with games that probably made us look suspiciously drunk, anyways. Source: http://sittingatthecrossroads.wordpress.com/ Source: http://sittingatthecrossroads.wordpress.com/ Work-filled weekend, but I did get to visit the Sardine Can, which was a quaint change from the mayhem that is Saturday night in Gastown. It almost feels like it’s in a weird corner protected by a forcefield where you can watch the rest of the street, which was surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly) filled with party-goers who have the supreme ability to brace the cold in nothing but short dresses or douchey muscle shirts. I applaud you. And my glass of Rias Baixas and snack-ins made just the fanciest popcorn as I watched you trot across the street in high heels, with you attempting to avoid getting run over by that one cab. I’m such an asshole.   I prepared for Tuesday. There was a big industry tasting in the early afternoon, and then I went and napped at home before heading out to the grand staff party. I got a headache somewhere in the middle of the day which prevented the shameless second and third glassfuls of Rioja and Beaujolais. Though my ridiculous idea of bringing note cards to the event with the intention of scribbling down tasting notes had failed thanks to a sad little spilled glass of beer, I do remember tasting a young Savennières which didn’t seem very intense until you felt both the weight and the strange savoury wet wooliness that it left on your palate. Quite the wine, and quite the cheeky youth.

So, our instructor disappeared for five minutes and sourced this bottle out from who knows where. Wahoo! Definitely New World on the nose. The upfront (yet elegant) red fruit gave it away, and I jumped to conclusions and headed straight to California as a guess. I missed a lot of the non-fruit components which I picked up afterwards, and New Zealand made much more sense. New Zealand Pinot has quite a distinctive fruity yet funky and spicy nose that can often be hard to miss (except when you’re me). Some noted that the Pinot vegetal and mushroom characteristics were a little more spoken on the palate. There was a little bit of well-integrated woody characteristics as well, and the fruit was concentrated – although the finish lacked a bit of balance. In terms of the umbrella of New Zealand, apparently wines from this region (Martinborough) will be the most Burgundian (which makes sense according to the analyses and conclusions of some classmates), with Central Otago having a distinct sage and darker character, and Marlborough being the lightest.
