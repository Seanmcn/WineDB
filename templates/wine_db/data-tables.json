Fair, I guess, but still slightly underwhelming, but a nice refresher on doing tasting notes. This time around WSET has simplified colour intensity descriptors, meaning that there will only be three descriptors (pale/medium/deep) instead of the three plus the two extended middling descriptors (pale/medium(-)/medium/medium(+)/deep). I’m not sure whether or not this will be better down the road, but for now it seems like it’ll be less annoying when doing a tasting note. We also have to justify the quality level we give, which I pretty much do in my blog posts anyways. All I have to do is tone down the sass. I’m guessing that this session was Pinot Grigio heavy because of our discussion on its current popularity in BC, and perhaps in other regions. This one in particular was more of an elegant style, with nothing more than restrained but friendly citrus and green fruit character which was more intense on the palate.",

A mistake, but we tasted it anyways, with the limited time and tired tongues we had. Yes – tired tongues, dark teeth, and stained lips. I try not to smile on the way home. Good quality – there is a fair amount of red fruit supported by the gamey earthiness of the Mourvèdre. They often make a great couple – the oxidative, blousy, and candied Grenache often balances with the reductive nature of Mourvèdre plus its meaty, more serious tones, although Syrah/Shiraz is usually added as some sort of middle ground and recognizable name.

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 2: Loire Valley] One of my wine friends convinced me to buy a Savennières for Thanksgiving. I was really on the fence on spending that much on a wine (school is expensive!), but through several points including celebration, treating myself because of my new certification, and Thanksgiving itself, I decided to go for it. And so I slowly nursed a bottle of 2007 Domaine des Baumard Trie Spéciale to myself on (Canadian) Thanksgiving. I’m sure no one else around me would have enjoyed a bottle that tasted like cream of mushroom and delicious wet winter sweaters. Savennières is a small appellation in the northern part of Anjou, where dry and concentrated wines from Chenin Blanc are made. Other appellations like Quarts de Chaume, Coteaux du Layon, and Bonnezeaux in the southern parts of Anjou typically make sweeter versions, so Savennières is almost like the weird dry anomaly. It used ti be sweeter in the past, and legally, I still think it can, but why do that, when you can make something weird, dry, and full-bodied, like me? Here we revisit another one of Baumard’s wines – one which I’ve had several times within the past few years. Perhaps I was just in a theatrical mood but my eyes did roll to the back of my head when I tasted it. It’s lusciously strange – much like the 2007 Trie Spéciale, it has a full mushroomy body with lots of mineral, wet wool, and hints of fruit. A classmate asked the instructor whether or not this could age, and she passionately responded “of course!”, and how the wine is currently only starting to show hints of development. The wine is apparently unappetizing at an age less than 7 years, but I suppose this truism can be bypassed for such a great years like 2009. Compared to the 2007 Trie Spéciale, this wine is a bit lighter on the nose and slightly lighter on the palate, but is still full-bodied. Like the 2007, the acid isn’t as super high as I expected, but perhaps this wine is part of the modern camp of Savennières that are made to mature quicker.

      "description": "This was my first Wine Bloggers Conference – I partially regret not going last year, but at the same time, I justified my absence because my co-worker attended, so I thought work wouldn’t let us both take time off. Ironically, the bulk of us are on vacation in a couple of weeks. Last year’s conference was in Penticton, i.e. it was literally super close to home, so I really do deserve a slap on the wrist for missing that one. I couldn’t resist not going to attend this year’s conference in Santa Barbara – first, California. Wine. Hi. Second, it would provide me with a fabulous answer for anyone that would ask what I was up to this summer, and I wouldn’t have to come up with a fancy complicated way to say “nothing”. Easy sell! It was an intense whirlwind of wine, people, and vineyards. I figure that the only way to neatly communicate what I’ve taken away from the conference is to do some sort of David Letterman slash Buzzfeed-esque top 10 countdown. Dreadful! I’m doing it anyways, just like that cheap 1L bottle of plonk I bought last week. I swear, I was holding it for a friend!  I can name the 60-something châteaux of the 1855 Bordeaux classification, but watch me get lost in a large airport. I don’t travel very often. I could, but the angel on the shoulder of my wallet says I probably shouldn’t, and so I’m definitely in a sea of complete unknownness when it comes to travelling alone. Thank God for fellow wine friends Valerie and Donita for being my partners during the trip. LAX was a weird Pan’s Labyrinth of an airport with odd terminals and airport announcements that for some reason sounded like grumbled up horror movie ransom audio, but fortunately we found the correct terminal that would take us to Santa Barbara. Donita was a former travel agent, so her patience while guiding me through travel stuff on the phone – weeks before the trip – was awesome. Gold stars and hugs for you both! What sort of person doesn’t say they’ve been bitten by this stupid proverbial travel bug after a good trip? Come a couple weeks time, I’m heading off to see more wine country. It’s time for the Okanagan – I’m really just making up for lost time (and drunkenness) last year. obligatory  Perhaps I’m shooting myself in the foot for even mentioning this. Greetings, potential employers! Naw, I’m just not used to it. Getting my business cards in the mail evoked a slightly adult-like sensation despite my blog’s dopey logo on the front. Huzzah – these were the bits of Josh I’d give out to people. Don’t get me wrong – I like people, I like talking to people, I’m not afraid of talking to people. But the oft-insincere action of meeting someone for thirty seconds and then moving on to the next person for the sake of getting a business card weirds me out. It’s even cringeworthy when you’re seeing it happen and the people are definitely tossing around fake giggles and smiles while they shamelessly try to shove their product down someone’s throat. But I’m sure I’m just being a complete ass about the whole thing. Maybe I’m repressing a hilarious memory that’ll make for an embarrassing story. That sounds about right.  I really didn’t think I would get anything out of applying for the scholarship. I went for it anyways to see what would happen – I eventually got chosen, which was awesome – like 15-minute-dance-party-at-1AM awesome. And I really really really hate to sound like I’m being self-righteous here, but the fact that I was chosen perhaps means that someone on the scholarship committee saw something in me, perhaps a thing that can be eventually moulded into something useful or cool. Something Tyra Banks would give me a sassy motivational speech about. I don’t know. But I sure did feel fuzzy inside. There’s really not a modest way of talking about what the scholarship means to me. I’m a young wine student who works in wine retail, with a dopey blog in a wine world full of wine businesspeople and cool sommeliers. Conferences like this, I realize (e.g. see #4) help me not only learn about wine and the regions of focus but help realize how I fit – and how I want to fit – in the industry. You can buy wine, but experience is a tough thing to get your hands on. So I’m grateful for this whole experience, really. And to that, I once again thank the sponsors for the experience and the motivation to do something great instead of sitting in my pyjamas on my laptop at 3PM. Instead, I can sit down in my pyjamas on my laptop at 3PM with a glass of wine and be motivated to write something awesome. My only regret is that I only got to meet some of you and not all of you.   Okay – so WSET Diploma tasting exams are timed, and so are tasting exams (verbally for the higher levels) for the Court of Master Sommeliers. Enter the speed tasting event of the WBC. Along with tasting concisely while attempting to listen to the wine reps and forming a hopefully witty tweet around a wine, there’s the added challenge of not spilling anything on your laptop. I was thankfully successful, unlike that 10-dollar Cabernet Sauvignon incident of November 2012 nor the Belgian Rye IPA incident of a couple of June 2014. I think that in those cases I definitely wasn’t drinking fast enough. Or maybe I should stop placing my glasses right in front of my laptop and being a klutz. There was also a mini party in our room with 80s music playing on my laptop – it’s a wonder nothing spilled on my laptop due to (my) flailing arms during anything Madonna-related.  i.e. Carl’s Jr. runs at 3AM.    Sure – there’s Napa, there’s Sonoma. That’s what people think about when the idea of Californian wine comes to mind, with matching big jammy reds and heavily oaked and creamed corn-scented Chardonnays to boot. I wasn’t sure exactly what to expect when planning to march off to Santa Barbara, but I guess that was the point – to explore a smaller and quieter region with more finessed and refreshing whites, to the grittier reds that still contained the new world spirit of California. I suppose with a smaller region and even smaller appellations (like the one my bus explored, Happy Canyon AVA), there’s a really cool sense of support and camaraderie between the handfuls of wineries that are in each small region. That’s definitely one thing I enjoyed.  The keynote speech of the Wine Bloggers Conference seems like the de facto sit-down event of the conference. I wasn’t exactly sure what to expect, and I was looking forward to it, but for some reason, sometimes listening to motivational speeches gives me the creepy crawlies. So my ease sort of melts away during the keynote speech, and I’m sitting there questioning everything while mostly everyone’s eyes light up like they’re being fed inspirational lightbulbs. There’s the usual stuff – welcome to the conference, it’s been going strong for 7 years, my name is Corbett Barr, etc. We learn how blogging is different for wine compared to other subjects that are blogged about: few earn a living compared to other subjects, the wine blogging community isn’t as tight, there aren’t as many industry-level bloggers, and the number of leaders are relatively few. We come to the hopeful conclusion that wine blogging isn’t at its “golden age”, and we address certain roadblocks and ways to overcome them. I find it difficult to identify with the bulk of these roadblocks simply because my “mission” is mostly embryonic or simply nonexistent. Two years ago, my blog started off as a collection of tasting notes that veered into the direction of reviews, but eventually levelled off into a goal of nihility. My blog was – and perhaps still is – a dimly lit closet made up of one part scrapbook and one part diary, and whoever decided to peer into its dusty contents was surely welcome. But I do it for no direct “purpose”, which is perhaps why my About Me page seems like a bit of an egotistic and malformed resumé without any sort of promise of provision. My blog mostly just serves to be some sort of weird egotistic extension of self. So much that these solutions to addressing said “roadblocks” feel like we’re trying to find ways to change who I am. Which obviously wasn’t the message, but the speech evoked a big Question that’ll be the next big Thing I’ll have to address: do I need a more direct mission or direction? Should my blog be more like something else or less like another? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe what my life needs is a dramatic soundtrack.  One of my favourite events was the excursion out to Happy Canyon. My wine education has mostly geared me towards being interested in the wines themselves. Click on a random blog post and there’s a good chance that I’ll talk about the wine and not the people behind it – so getting to interact with people who actually get the juice into the bottle was really cool. James Conaway, one of the writers on the panel of wine writers, accentuated the importance of focussing on people from a wine journalist’s point of view. Come the second night, I didn’t realize that my late-night crew included Jon, winemaker of Hand of God wines. I was fortunate enough to try his wines before he had to jet off early, which was unfortunate. I also vaguely remembering all of us dancing to Get Lucky at some dive bar a couple blocks away from our respective hotels at 2AM.  A lot of people seemed to be irked by the panel of winemakers and the panel of wine writers. A lot of people made blog posts about how there wasn’t enough diversity on the panels, or in the case of the wine writers, not enough diversity in their respective communicative media, wine education, gender, and so on. At the same time, this really made me smile in the slightest, because perhaps it means that there’s so much more room for the global group of wine writers (and wine people in general) to grow. And I don’t mean to sound like an inspirational commercial that at one point has a picture of the earth and fancy string music, but there’s so much potential for unique voices to come forward in a community that according to Corbett Barr, hasn’t reached its golden age.

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 6: Rhône] The middle three wines in this flight were notably similar: so we were given three choices. One was a simple Côtes du Rhone, one was a step high in quality as a Côtes du Rhône Villages, and one was a step higher in quality than that, as another appellation in the Southern Rhone, or an appellation that used to be at the Villages level but was drawn into its own appellation. I thought that the third in the flight was the obvious simple CdR level, because it didn’t have the same concentration, intensity, or length. That left us with the first two, which were actually rather similar. I found this one slightly less exuberant compared to the first, and perhaps less friendly in its aromas. Not in a bad way, of course – but fruitier aromas were replaced by more game, spice, and what I noted as a sort of rubbery character, as well as liquorice. I eventually deemed this the highest quality of the three because of its longer length and slightly more complex visage. The palate was also a bit rougher and bulkier, with the structure being slightly imbalanced. The relatively expressive flavours and pretty rough texture makes me picture a burlap sack with thick threads full of black fruit, spices, and soil, almost tearing at the seams because of how tough it is to keep everything in the bag.

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 1] Yeah! Rioja stunner on the first day. In the first few wafts of the wine, you get this intoxicating and familiar savoury soy characteristic which sort of masks the dried red fruit and makes it seem more brooding than it is. That soy quality is a common benchmark in aged Rioja, for sure, but there’s something about this that yelled Sangiovese to me. Both Chianti Classico and Rioja Reserva see oak, though the former sees a minimum of 7 months while the latter sees a minimum of 12 months. Oak is still something I struggle with, and I’m sure there’s a wood joke in there somewhere that I’m not going to bother venturing because it seems suspiciously easy. Anyways. The acidity was stunningly high as were the tannins – though the texture was soft and well-rounded from age. As per the nose, the palate also revealed fantastic dried herb and tertiary flavours that enveloped the brooding dried red fruit, which veered onto the darker black cherry tones. There was definitely some weird wavelength going on in the room since the classmate who read out her notes also guessed a 7-year-old Sangiovese, though I went with Chianti Classico and she went with Brunello di Montalcino. I feel like there’s a slight imbalance with the alcohol and acid, but that’s just me being picky. Fully developed, the instructor said, so there’s really no room for this wine to go anywhere from ageing. I mean, I suppose you can try, and it will change in some way, but it’s beautiful now.

But yes: definitely a marked nutty pastry aroma combined with ripe apple aromas and just mere suggestions to more tropical ripeness, with honey and caramel to boot. The guess of vintage Champagne was a bit of a gamble. Though I need to further explore the nuances of Champagne and sparkling wine (lol), I did get a bit of an obvious nutty and oxidized sort of finish. I attributed this to age, though I supposed house style could be put into play here, if the wine was matured in oak barrels. Definitely playful, fun, classic, and a bit more mature and well-rounded from age. A bit more of a grand orchestral number compared to the second wine in our flight. Bubbles weren’t noticeably youthful but had a rather quiet finesse, unfortunately losing carbonation much more quickly than the others in the flight.

Not in an overtly negative way, of course, but just as part of its personality: the wine did have a good level of intensity and concentration, even though some complexity and length was left to the imagination. For old world Pinot, I find that there can be that difficult balance between being elegant and being watery. There’s a bit of a parallel in warmer regions, where you don’t want to amp up the volume too much, since excessive ripeness can take over Pinot’s elegance. So it’s great that Pinot is being grown in the cooler pockets like the Yarra Valley and Tasmania, where we can find ballsier but balanced versions of Pinot Noir. Despite riper fruit, there was still an element of cleansing acid, bits of fine tannin, and a bit of oak. I’m sort of a fan. And whatever, wine from Tasmania just sounds compelling.",

Lighter and more driven by flowers, strawberries, and red cherries compared to the Chambertin. It’s often said that Pinot Noir from the Côte de Beaune creates wines that are lighter, fruitier, and prone to earlier maturation than that of the north. Much more pure in fruit than the basic Burgundy we tried a couple of wines before, if you were to compare the first wine to blurry vision à la Velma losing her glasses, and then this wine to putting on a stylin’ pair. Maybe with a floral pattern or sparkles or something. Unicorn stickers. “Pretty” was the one word we came up with that we thought described Savigny-Lès-Beaune to a T.

A common argument is that “they make you feel sick and therefore people don’t want a red”, but a surprisingly large amount of people don’t know that white and sweet wines actually have a higher proportion of sulphites. Sulphites act as both a yeast-supresser and as antioxidants, which is important when you don’t want your wine fermented a second time, especially if you have a fair amount of residge in your wine. (And other reasons which I am unfit to describe which is a shame since I’m currently reading through the wine technology book that explains it all) And this was a good example of such a wine: unfortunately, despite its light petrol and green fruit deliciousness, much of the wine was dominated by this smokey matchstick-like character, which was predicted to be due to the sulphites.

This is a great example of its style, where bright Alsatian Riesling is mouth-commanding and almost abrasive, reminding me of a young and irritatingly chipper business-forward politician or Daenerys Targaryen.

Perhaps its the intentionally oxidized and hence “aged” sort of character, or perhaps its the fact that these types of wines are the stereotypical grandma-standard of beverages. Who knows. Regardless, this inspired the obvious Edward Sharpe song pairing, which was introduced to me during some year in university and was subsequently blasted picturesquely during a spring break road trip down to the United States. Which was rendered partially useless, anyways, because none of us were really legal to drink. Nor would half the group even do so even if allowed. Ugh. I have such an odd hobby. But we took the roadtrip seating charts seriously, and we took a couple of hours in the library to plan out seven different combinations to seat the seven of us in the van, complete with the debated topic on who chose the ambient music. Good times. Nearby students in the library tried to make suggestions. Anyways, Oloroso sherry is essentially a wine destined to be on the the more nutty and dark end of the sherry spectrum, compared to the fresh and briny flor-dominated end that is Fino. This wine was outstanding. It’s the amazing example of a wine that evinces flavours of delectable nutty caramel pastries without the sugar. It’s an interesting situation. The wine also has an intense savoury fleshiness that expresses itself when it leaves the palate, leaving behind a fervid sherry footprint of wonder.

And yummy – quite obviously on the tawny side of the port spectrum, mainly showcasing oxidative characteristics with mere hints to any sort of fruit. Lucky guess on the identity. The colour was reddish but not enough for me to guess a 10-year-old, though that just leaves my imagination to wonder what a 30- or 40-year-old tawny port reveals, since this was already non-fruity and tertiary-ish to begin with. Hmm. Quite complex, though my port senses are quite evidently primitive since I wasn’t exactly sure where to place quality at first. Discussions led to its “very good” quality realization (even up to outstanding), and I mentally noted that I really need to taste more of this stuff. Picking up complex character is a little easier for sparkling wines, but for some reason the fortified equivalent is much more difficult for me. Or perhaps it’s the non-guzzling quality that leads me to not buy these wines every week, instead going for the sparkling and watching guilty pleasure reality TV shows on the “weekends”. Which, according to some dumb infographic, means I’m both unintelligent and inevitably going to end up poor. Oh well! Or maybe you can do that with port – all you need are proper complex ports like these, complete with desserts and cheese to pair with, a pillow in which to sob, sweatpants (or a onesie), and some sappy rom com(s). And pizza. But that’s before the port and maybe throw in some cheap red wine in the mix. You can tell I’m obviously stoked for Valentine’s Day.

I understand the general nutty appeal of other sherries, but the brine, white almond, and citrus can sometimes be a bit of an enigma to some people. So really, Palomino can be the ugly duckling that just happens to stay ugly and weird. On one hand, I understand why no one will touch Fino with a 10-foot pole (I’m actually laughing because I realized this is a thing though), but I also feel like there’s probably some food pairing I’m missing, here. There was a discussion in class about how Fino sherry really is a food wine. And I’m optimistically wondering and gazing off into the distance (complete with growling stomach), wondering if Fino can possibly be a catch-all versatile firecracker to Filipino food. Or other food I haven’t considered, for that matter. I’m legitimately going to test it out. Perhaps Fino will be the future hero to a young generation full of Instagram foodies. That sounds scary and exciting. You heard it here first, folks! We’re rooting for you, ugly Pal-omino!!!

It’s almost been exactly two years since I started the diploma. WOAH DUDES. I’ll save more I-can’t-believe-it’s-been-this-long-etc-etc-omg sentiments for next week. My best friend’s birthday was on the 4th and he planned some long string of activities including pool, clubbing, and other miscellaneous turnt-esque activities. Still not feeling life, generally, so I stayed for just the first bit, which means I attempted the geometrically bro-y activity of pool (after much external convincing) while studying German flash cards on my phone when people weren’t looking. I went home after that to watch The Grand Budapest Hotel and drink Alsatian Gewurztraminer in lieu of clubbing (sorry Chris) which raised my mood in the slightest. We’re opposites, basically. How to combine the nerdy glory of trigonometry with the awkward shame of high school gym class. #badatthis 33 Acres and Charlie’s Little Italian on Friday. And then wine party, where my blind tasting skills were tested and I generally failed completely. But then again, I was also at 33 Acres and Charlie’s Little Italian just before, and I think what was impressive was my ability to trudge through life despite everything I decided to pour into my mouth that day. Three cheers for my liver, and insert that link here. That link everyone’s been sharing on Facebook about how a glass of wine equals an hour at gym or whatever etc etc etc  I read this book called “Wine Politics” by Tyler Colman aka Dr. Vino. The first bit was good but very history-laden (the book focusses on France and the US), and the latter parts discussed lots of contemporary issues involving governmental structure, appellation law, wine popularity, wine critics, and evolving attitudes. Really entertaining and informative if not a bit depressing, seeing how so much of the market is controlled by such big and rich companies who sell monochromatic wine. After I finished the book I felt much more enlightened yet grey clouds started to form as if I’d just bitten into forbidden grapes from the Garden of Eden. Beer that’s delicious; wine that’s auspicious #drunkreading Class was about the South of France and South America, not only in terms of wine but business as well. 9 wines. Oi. Some of them were shit so I guess you gotta make up for it. The non-vintaged Concha Y Toro “Frontera” Merlot ($9) was impressive in my opinion, with a bit of gentle greenness and simple plum, showing – at least – some varietal character despite its bareness. The J.P. Chenet 2013 Pinot Noir ($14), on the other hand, was confected and sort of gross, being simultaneously unripe yet disjointedly and artificially ripe at the same time. I once worked at a store that sold this regularly, and one colleague bought this often because it “looked expensive” and he thought it impressed his girlfriend or something. K. Two blends from the south of France were next: the Domaine Modat 2010 Côtes du Roussillon Villages Caramany ($39) was notably textured and brawny, with lots of evolved black fruit and spice, while the Hecht & Bannier 2011 Saint-Chinian ($30) had more tar and garrigue notes to display, though its body was a bit lighter. Some whites in the middle to refresh our palates I suppose (though I thought both of them were kinda gross), and despite their blandness they illustrated something, at least, with the French Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2013 Sauvignon Blanc ($13) showing much less grassy character than the Chilean Veramonte 2013 Sauvignon Blanc ($14), because the grapes from the former were grown in a much generally warmer and thus less suitable climate for Savvy Blanc. I didn’t even pick up on the grassiness in the first wine (why are tasting Pinot Grigio in this class?) and so I ventured a vague guess of Picpoul. I still think the Chilean wine was kinda only okay but I’d pick it over that first one any day. Carmenere was bound to appear somewhere in the flight, with its tomato soup head evaporating from the glass and into all of our noses. The Bisquertt 2012 “Ecos de Rulo” Carmenere ($20) had lots of meaty fruit to support the tomato leaf character which was rather nice. In comparison, the Intriga 2011 Cabernet Sauvignon ($28) seemed so earthy and herb-scented that I definitely thought it was a Cahors chosen to provide a contrast to the last wine – the Vistalba 2012 “Corte C” ($20) – in the flight, but alas, it was a Chilean Cab. I’m supposed to go to a party on Friday. Hmm. Concha Y Toro “Frontera” Merlot  – WSET Tasting Note: J.P.

There are times when I can’t decide between “ruby” and “purple” by WSET colour standards, but this was a viscous liquid that legitimately and lazily left a film of violet on the inside of the glass, the last bits of the wine refusing to even fall out entirely. Kind of like how infatuation sickeningly refuses any accessibility to your senses or reality. HA. It doesn’t help that the name of the port house is “Cockburn’s” with all these comparisons. Can I start new sommelier slang? “Ugh, he’s such a Cockburn’s vintage 2011 if you know what I mean.” It smelt and tasted exactly how it looked, with lusty dark fruit notes reminding me of some heavily extracted still Californian and Portuguese reds. Intense and ripe dark fruits mostly shrouded my nose and taste buds – there was almost none of that nutty, spicy, oxidative, and chocolate character that you get out of aged vintage port. There was the comment that all young and serious port will be like this, with an extracted and intense character involving tannins, acid, alcohol, and flavour in fiery disharmony. Young vintage port is perhaps one of the better poster children in describing a wine whose elements really need the time to fit into each other, develop the flavours, and become balanced. That being said, I quite enjoyed this, but I might as well stick to the big extracted Californian and Portuguese reds if I want to avoid a hole in my wallet. Or diabetes. And then I got excited when I realized I could buy one of these famed vintage ports – since 2011 has been one of the best years in history – then open it on something like a wedding night, and then I realized that this would probably just depress me.

I also think it’s the creepiest sounding one, and I’d love to both know the story behind it and also keep a bottle on hand every time someone tells me something is part of “God’s plan”. Then I can, in just an ominous whisper, say “no, this is part of God’s plan”, and then subsequently uncork the bottle without breaking eye contact. And then get really drunk. It’s foolproof – to what, I don’t even remember or care. Anyways, this was our second wine in our flight of five, with the first wine being an obvious Tavel and the last perhaps being an aged and less obvious Châteauneuf-du-Pape. The middle three wines were Côtes du Rhône blends of some sort, and the third of the middle three wines seemed of the lowest quality. This and the second wine were rather similar, though this one had slightly less earth, less tannin, but slightly more acid. The shorter length had me guess this as the blend at the Villages level, though the amount of complexity and sturdiness still had me rank this as very good.

The rating – or overall comment, rather – on this wine, is that it’s “extraordinarily exceptional”, which equates to the author’s prestigious 2-star stamping. But these bubbles seemed so fantastically boring to me. The wine is made from a majority of Chardonnay, which is both shrug-worthy and perhaps shocking. The former mainly due to the clean, crisp, and neutral style – but the latter, because of the rather low proportion of traditional Cava grapes used. Codorníu and Freixenet are the two main big boy houses of Cava. But unlike Freixenet, Codorníu finds itself being a little bit more progressive, with the house pushing for the usage of the non-traditional grape. This isn’t to say that Chardonnay is the unneeded foreign germ in the recipe of Cava – because I believe that it can add depth and finesse as it does in other traditionally made sparklings. I just don’t think that it fits the bill in this case. At one point I stamped this as acceptable quality as did at least one other classmate of mine (who also guessed its identity as Prosecco). Perhaps it’s the short nine-month period of ageing on the lees which gives it too clean of a character, but one perceptive classmate picked up on some yeastiness, where others didn’t. Impressive, to say the least. The wine was more “brute” than “brut”, with aggressive bubbles and a clean-shaven profile attempting to muscle their way in to impress you rather than let the flavours do their enticing. Anna must have had quite the arms. But it reminds me more of that archetypal muscled jerk at the beach. (But maybe I just miss the sun.)",

The classmate to my left thought it was hilarious that I was writing a tasting note because it was that horrid, and I really thought it wouldn’t be. The wine was a strange colour between pink and pale brown. The nose seemed to have faint ghostly aromas of the slightly nutty and alcoholic aftermath that were probably low-quality grapes destined for high-yielding “sherry” production. The palate was equally as questionable with a medium-sweet sugar level, non-existent acid, and slightly more intense flavours. But from the nut water on the nose, we move on to this cocktail of stale nuts and cough syrup topped off with a couple of Halls lozenges. It’s easy to hate something like this, it really is. But it’s an example of a product that’s cheap and easier to access for those who get drunk for the sake of it: the entire class inevitably and almost necessarily had a short political discussion, and then in slow astonishment, I realized that such a cheap and shitty product automatically destined as garbage in the wine world holds quasi-importance in other aspects. It’s weird. It tastes like sad. If I have my facts correctly – starting earlier this year (January 1, 2014), Canada (and perhaps other regions?) is no longer allowed to use the word “Sherry” (or “Port”, I think, for that matter) to sell products made in that style but aren’t from the protected EU regions. So the word they’re using to describe these products now is “apera” (which I think we apparently borrowed from the Australians). Hence the name. You probably shouldn’t buy this.",

Just after tying up my Superman chucks and opening the door to jet out to the bus that’s almost at my bus stop, I see this huge package in my mailbox which I can only hope is my WSET Advanced-level books. And it is. So I snatch it and run for my bus. I dizzily flip through it and end up with some lack-of-sleep-early-morning-physical-extertion-motion-sickness nausea, but new books, or new reading material – new anything, for that matter, is too exciting to pass. </consumerism> I also accidentally knocked over a 12-bottle box of beer. Thankfully only one of the bottles broke. But yeah. Tuesdays are delivery days and so I happened to bring in some exciting physics to an otherwise decent day. Also bought a couple more beers to try (for extending my knowledge, of course…). The Samuel Smith’s Raspberry Fruit Ale is apparently good (I’ve only ever had the strawberry). Another colleague suggested two more beers which I shall try later. Anyways, I digress. Another colleague has once again chosen a wine for me to taste blind. Apparently it takes a while for the wine to open up, which I can understand – all I got at first were notes of basic red fruit, and vague spicy aromas of black pepper, cloves, and liquorice. Sour cherry notes are starting to appear, as well as this earthiness. I know I should let it open up more, but I can’t help but want to reveal this wine soon. It’s reminiscent of this BC Pinot Noir I had recently – that earthiness is coming through. What strikes me different are the notes of sour cherry, though. I’m going with either Pinot Noir, Grenache or perhaps something light like a Valpolicella. I’m thinking of risking a new world guess, although it’s hard to tell. I don’t know. It’s not too complex (but at the same time, it’s not boring and simple) – I wouldn’t price this higher than 25 dollars, and that’s already a stretch. I can tell that the quality is good though. Nothing sticks out. Good structure. Aha! Revealed. The Italian classic-looking label honestly made my heart drop, because I was really settled on the Grenache thing, but at least I considered a Valpolicella. The price though – the price is almost ridiculous, I think. I’m honestly not that impressed with it – but I’ll give it another chance to open up. I don’t know, though – maybe it’s because I recently went to a wine fair where I literally tasted around 50 Italian wines in a row. So maybe I’m subconsciously and temporarily numb to them. All in all, it was okay. Nothing special, although this was balanced and solid – I’ll give it that much. Edit: it turns out that a lot of people at work were really one-or-the-other about this wine. Literally half of my colleagues didn’t really enjoy it while the other half really liked it.

The grape is deceivingly pale in colour but is high in alcohol, acid, and tannin. Thus, it’s supposed to be such a roughhouse, but it’s not. It’s elegant despite the tannin. I often mistake the body for being lighter than it really it, even though 14.5% is blatantly high on the alcohol scale, inevitably leading to a heavier body. Classic aromas? I’m reminded of the “tar and roses” mantra. But it’s true – the dried foral elements often couple with this distinct dark forest-like earth. Sour red fruit and other savoury elements finish its personality. Nebbiolo is wholly masculine and feminine all at the same time – and as beautiful as it really sounds, it’s a bit more than an acquired taste. It really is a wine geek’s grape. Vietti is probably one of the most well known premium producers of Italian wines around these wine hills, and the Barbaresco was no exception. The tannins are high, coarse, and mouth-coating, almost right down to your lips, even in a riper year. But they’re strikingly balanced.

      "description": "Bordeaux is in a bit of a tough spot at the moment – which isn’t saying much – but it’s far from being an underdog: Eric Asimov discusses this in a New York Times article in May 2010. The region in question once simultaneously exuded both normalcy and the unattainable; a seemingly conventional gateway wine to all other wines, yet having this aura of hubris and higher social status. But now that so many more wines are available, and with a new generation seeking wines that are anything but normal, it seems that less people are raising their hands for the classic French region. But I mean hey: people still whore out special bottles of Bordeaux for likes on Instagram, and a blog post on the mass-produced Mouton Cadet 2012, for some reason, is quite statistically popular. Personally, Bordeaux is a bit of a weak spot for me, simply because good examples can be pricey, and I often buckle and resort to recommendations of South America any time anyone asks for a Bordeaux at affordable prices. I jumped on the chance to attend an event by the Union des Grands Crus de Bordeaux, 2016 being the first visit to Vancouver by this group of wineries. Challenge accepted. 2013, the vintage of focus, was a less-than-ideal year full of rain and rot that resulted in wines with a lighter-footed disposition, though the wines tasted were from high quality producers: if they weren’t orgasmic, they’d at least be, on average, on the higher side of solid. I was sort of excited to see what shitty vintages would reveal in archetypical producers: you find out a lot about a person during their bad days, and I suspect the same might be true with Bordeaux. Wines were found at both ends of dull and exciting, but the bell curve certainly peaks with a medium-bodied and sometimes forgettable style of Bordeaux expressing balance, and a bit of tight attitude in denser examples. Coincidentally (or not?) there was a British Columbia wine tasting happening literally just a crawl away, but since I experienced that last year, I opted for this one. After some beer, I realized that remnants of the other tasting were found on the street, including a brand new oyster-related shirt that I drunkenly decided to take home. And so we reach a critical dichtonomy in my personality: tasting thousands of dollars of Bordeaux and then taking home a shirt I found on the street. Obviously, tasting 74 wines in a crowded room is super tough within just a couple of hours: a duo of women asked me for advice on which tables they should visit, because it looked like I knew where I was going. In all honesty, I was trying to weave through the forest-like crowd with Flash-like efficiency and douchey elbow action, especially because of another couple who, at every table, decided it appropriate to elaborately share plans on how they were going to travel to Bordeaux and “maybe we should visit you, do you have a card?” (But maybe I should take a note from them: I hardly talk to the people behind the wines, and a happy accident before the tasting involving a conversation with a certain rockstar MW made me wonder if I should rethink my strategy.) Anyways, I decided that it would be a disservice to write about the Sauternes I tasted; they were undeniably sumptuous, delicious, and obviously underrated, but my fragmented tasting notes at the end of the string of reds and whites could definitely not do the sweet whites any justice, especially after the refreshing shock of nectar that came after glasses and glasses of tannin. I also skipped Château Lynch-Moussas (Pauillac) and Château Beaumont (Haut-Médoc) simply because their principals were not available at the time; and then Château Clerc Milon because my tasting note was hilariously hieroglyphic. Fun fact: Château Carbonnieux once labelled their wine “Mineral Water of Carbonnieux” to get around prohibition, though I would have gone with “Carbonnieux-ated Water”. Hold your applause. The 2013 Blanc ($75) had lots of obvious Sauvignon character, but I’ve tasted a vintage or two that’s been a lot less protruding. Guava, and lychee; medium-bodied and fresh with a long and waxy finish. The 2013 ($67) yielded bright cherry-driven fruit. Finessed; lighter and more vapid than I expected and the white certainly trumps this. Fresh-styled, if anything, with a fine sprinkle of tannin. The 2012 had more depth, warmth, structure, and plummy flavours than the previous, and wins. According to Oz Clarke, the whites of Domaine de Chevalier have often been the star of the domaine (France, even) and outshine their reds: the 2013 Blanc ($160) was indeed textured and waxy, though not as freshly driven as the Carbonnieux, but more of a relaxed pineapple with a gooseberry sort of thing on the finish. The 2013 ($86) was friendly, upfront, and plummy on the nose with a punchier palate. Somehow light yet tongue-coating, sassy and slippery with slightly chalky tannin. The 2009 was much more obviously complex, if that makes sense? Smells much more of earthy undergrowth, and drinking much more currently with nice balance between fruit and earth components. Apparently the whites of Château de Fieuzal are known for being rich and immediately accessible yet age-worthy, and indeed the 2013 Blanc ($92) was scented with green pineapple and honey, the palate also revealing a nervy citrus-charged current underneath. The 2012 Blanc ($91) had much lower acid, more easily showing lush pineapple, red apple, and honeycomb. Fuller than the 2013 and longer; just a year difference but there was a lot more oxidation here. A little less impressed with the reds than I was with the whites: the 2013 ($63) was mostly black cherry cough syrup, with even just a touch of sickliness on the nose. Moderate structure isn’t enough to provide the freshness that lacks. Y’know when it’s just one of those days when you need a belt? The 2012 was still packed with fruit, but there was a bit more finesse and earth to keep the plummy black cherry character in check. Told the principal that I preferred this one to the 2013 and he hesitated: he said this one was drinking more currently than the 2013 which he said needed more time to age. All in all, most impressed with the 2012 Blanc: wouldn’t re-Fieuzal a glass of it. LOL I’ll let myself out I’d want to meet the person who named Château de France? Like there’s gotta be a bitchy story about how someone claimed their Château in the name of the country. A little ironic that it’s the only château from Pessac-Léognan in this lineup that is not a Cru Classé de Graves. Pretty average stuff. The 2013 Blanc had a decent amount of gooseberry action, and can easily be a moderate intersection between modern Loire and Marlborough. Nervy and lacks a bit of depth, but strength was in its firmness and (probably) its longevity. The 2011 Blanc was weirdly more closed on the nose, but the palate was more open with more intense pineapple and vanilla. Brett, maybe, on the 2013? Nice amount of earthy grit on the nose. Pretty solid, with girthed chalky tannins. The 2011 was more ethereal and loose. More power and concentration. Pretty much just lightly supreme to the 2013 in every way. The Château Latour-Martillac 2013 Blanc was moderately fragrant with lychee and pineapple on the nose, but closed citrus on the palate. Most certainly too young and not as immediately gratifying as the other whites. The 2013 was a step lighter than medium-bodied, but the whole thing just seemed so simultaneously vague-fruited and rough; and light with some red berry character. The 2005 was much more interesting and fragrant with some dried plum and mushroom, but the palate still felt shy in the slightest. Delicious amount of tertiary character showing through. Organic, which is cool. The 2013 Blanc ($109) of Château Malartic-Lagravière seemed like the tightest white so far, donning over-elegance with lots of underripe pineapple, perhaps promising more life in the future. Too young? And isn’t Malartic a Pokemon?  The 2013 ($75) was mainly made of black cherry with a nice amount of warmth. Quite hard and tannic, but the fruit still showed through. In comparison, the 2011 was more concentrated and also had much more of an earthy disposition, though the palate still was a touch tight and hard. Slightly fuller than the average red Pessac-Léognan, which makes sense considering that I am now reading about the growth of its style into “New World richness”. Apparently the wines of Château Olivier were thin and shitty pre-1990s, before an injection of new oak and a serious dedication to quality from 2002 onwards due to a new manager. The 2013 Blanc ($69) was mostly composed of green apple and citrus; and then something pleasantly ripe and unripe at the same time. There’s something about this I don’t like, but I can’t put my finger on it. Maybe it’s trying too hard to be two things at once? Slight lack of integration or tension? The 2013 ($57.50) felt intrinsically Pessac-Léognan with an average basic plummy profile, medium body, and accessible structure. I was surprised (or maybe I shouldn’t be) to find out that only 11 hectares of Château Smith-Haut-Lafitte‘s land are planted with white grapes, their whites certainly spearheading any sort of surge of Bordeaux blanc (re)popularity in the future. The favourite of the whites tasted, the 2013 Blanc ($195.50) had a notable and wonderful intoxicating ripe leafy stink. Creamy guava with a nice amount of tension. Not too immediately gaudy on the scale like some other examples, which was different and delightful. The 2013 ($137) had a leafy char on the nose along with some saccharine black cherry on the palate. Lush and enjoyable, if not spilling over into hedonistic territory with chalky tannins to balance. The 2010 ($184) in comparison had more vanilla under some peppery plum on the palate. The evolution and difference seemed to be in the texture rather than the flavours at this point. Still a tad closed. Dumb phase? Unique about Château Canon La Gaffelière for the Merlot-dominated right bank Bordeaux is its almost half-and-half split of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in its wines. The 2013 gave flavours of earth, lots of vanilla, and dried plum. Rather medium-bodied and elegant with good concentration. Quite friendly; one of the easy slutty ones. I found Château La Couspaude rather dependable but ordinary. Some reviews boast the power in recent vintages, so perhaps the soft and medium body of the 2012 was a reflection of the year rather than style – though the ripe black fruit and fresh amounts of green pepper were enjoyable. The 2013 was not as stereotypically Bordeaux. It had more texture, but was not as exciting as the 2012. Having tasted the wines, I’m not surprised to learn that Michel Rolland consults with Château Dominique, which apparently is quite near Cheval Blanc, Figeac, L’Évangile, and La Conseillante. What’s a bit surprising to me is that only 70% of the grapes see new barrels (and for 18 months), which is less than some of the previous wines, though the 2013 gave off tons of sweet vanilla oak charm on the palate, prefaced by oaky restraint on the nose. Wonderfully ripe fruit. The 2010 was obviously much more open, but a louder iteration of the obvious vanilla, oak, and coconut, which was at least wrapped up by a fair amount of tannin. I don’t know much about Château Villemaurine except that it’s a comparatively small property of 7 hectares with a cool label. Though not super idiosyncratic, the wines seemed to set themselves apart with redcurrant-focussed fruit. The 2013 was medium-bodied and finessed, while the 2011 was more timid in expression but also a little more full and textured. The obvious red fruit among the plums in Château Beauregard‘s 2013, which even reaches strawberry, can probably be attributed to the higher proportion of Cabernet Franc in their blends. I thought it was an anomaly, or because I finally reached the Pomerols. A bit hole-y on the palate, in that there’s a fair amount of body and tannin but not enough stuffing. Lots of plum and obvious new oak in the 2013 version of Le Bon Pasteur, showing Michel Rolland’s fingerprints all over. Medium-bodied and hedonistic, despite the fact that there seems to be not enough fruit to match the tannin at this stage; evidently needs to loosen for some years. But like, should you ever need expensive Bordeaux to get over a break up… The 2013 of Château Clinet used to have Michel Rolland on board, but you wouldn’t guess this from the balance of lightness and opulence compared to the succulent Le Bon Pasteur. Plummy, with a fair amount of structure balanced with the body and tannin. The 2011 is more impressively balanced and concentrated, with more fruit and stickiness showing through – more akin to their general style according to Oz Clarke, and what I had thought was more of a Rolland influence, but it turns out Rolland no longer works with Clinet. Apparently Château Gazin has become much more mainstream since the middle of the 1990s. The wine sees 18 months in barrel, around half of which is new, attributing to the 2013‘s ($114) vanilla-kissed plums, along with its medium body, tautness, and tightness. Pomerol was apparently one of the regions that seemed to most escape the lower qualities of the less-than-average 2006 vintage in Bordeaux: indeed, Château Gazin’s version is much more meaty and concentrated than its 2013, with some BBQ amongst the lasting structure and black fruits. The wines of Château La Pointe seemed a little lighter and moderately structured in comparison to the rest of the Pomerols, with a friendly accessibility found in the light plummy fruit of the 2013. The 2011 was a bit more earthy and pungent, and driven by black cherry fruit. The château recently started to undergo a major renovation in 2008 in order to reach a fuller potential; along with a nod from Oz Clarke and help from co-owner of Château Angelus Hubert de Boüard de Laforest, I hope to keep my eye on this one. (I mean I can’t afford it so I’m just saying that for fun.) I like that Château Chasse-Spleen has been managed by women for the past thirty years; the estate has also historically commanded high prices – and quality to match – despite the fact that it belongs to a less famed appellation. In this current succession of Bordeaux, the 2013 a nice combo breaker with affable red and black raspberry fruits. Velvety and very accessible with nice tension, though it lacks a complete core: some fact-finding shows that this has been a stylistic evolution over the past few years, where vintages pre-2010 have shown more dark and opulent fruit. The 2011 holds a little more dried fruit on the nose, but there’s an echo of 2013‘s accessibility and softness. According to Oz Clarke, one of Château Maucaillou‘s strengths has been its reliability and balance between fruit and oak, which is exactly what I noted in the sumptuous and focussed 2013. A little more obvious green pepper in the 2010, and thus I found it a little more stereotypically Bordeaux, complete with a glossy palate and fantastic concentration. Oz goes on to say that more recent vintages have been weightier and perhaps more seemingly ambitious, though he also opines that the past formula wasn’t broken to begin with. God: Bordeaux really does get Game of Thrones-y, especially having read that two people from the famed Bordeaux châteaux of Gruaud-Larose and Chasse-Spleen have come together to own the fifth growth Château de Camensac in 2005. The wines are rather soft, exoteric, and discreet, the 2013 showing plummy raspberry fruit through a medium body, and the 2011 showing much more game, meat, and almost pepperoni through its rougher texture. “Camensac” means something like “on the water’s way”. I can’t wait to convolutedly whip that out in conversation. The move to reduced oak treatment really shows in the 2013 vintage of Château Citran, where the main burst of cassis shows a clarity of herbs and green pepper amongst a chalky tannic structure. Maybe a wine to pair with colds and flus?   I don’t know much about the 38 hectares of Château de Lamarque, except for the fact the estate possesses a beautiful castle, and that it’s one of the more reliable châteaux of the Haut-Médoc. The powdery 2013 was ashy, with flavours of cassis and plum; the 2011 was a little more open-knit and leathery. Solid and tame, I guess, if not just a little unexciting.  Being one of the oldest estates in the Médoc, as well as being one of Oz Clarke’s sentimental favourites, Château Angludet‘s 2013 had notable and immediate floral scents against the background of plummy earth and meaty char. Good value is a theme for this estate, apparently. Years ago I read somewhere that Château Malescot Saint-Exupéry wasn’t great value, and indeed I’m learning now about how the wines of this third growth became watery in the 1980s. Both examples I tasted were both charming and supple, the 2013 being lighter, cassis-driven, and aromatic, while the 2009 was much more brooding, peppery, and concentrated, though still intrinsically lithe. Wines of fourth growth Château Marquis de Terme have apparently been quite tannic and needing time in the best years, being rather prosaic until the improvements of the 2000s. Their style tends to be on the chunkier side for the silky charm of Margaux, and as expected, the 2013 feels just a bit tight with its strength, though the character that shows through is quite lush, with some charred plums and a hint of dried black fruit. I’ve always been a fan of Grand Bateau, the waxy entry-level white Bordeaux by fourth growth Château Beychevelle. This is my first exposure to their focal wine, whose quality has been often compared to that of a second growth. I did note that the 2013 was unlike a lot of examples tasted up until this point, with lots of layered and aromatic cassis flavour despite the palate’s lightness and structure. A lot more obvious power, structure, and breadth in the 2009, and a fair amount of leathery evolution.  Third growth Château Lagrange has been known for its depth and tannic authority, especially since the 1980s, needing time to showcase its best. Though the wines were good, the two vintages on offer for tasting seemed to lack this inherent style, though some other châteaux kept theirs. Though aromatic with a some ruggedness, for example, the 2013 was quite medium-bodied and soft with lots of black fruit and gummy cassis; the 2011 was more subtle and friendlier still, though with more of a spicy undertone. I care not to bore myself – in the current moment, at least – to learn about the ownerships and marriages that resulted in all of these following hyphenated châteaux names, though supposedly Château Langoa-Barton, a third growth, is more cheerful, jolly, and full compared to Léoville-Barton, which is essentially a second growth owned by the same family, and virtually the same estate. Chateau Langoa-Barton‘s 2013 was not so aromatic but definitely had a redcurrant presence with lots of finesse, while the 2012 was earthier with herb-scented action. Neither seemed particularly compelling, but Château Léoville-Barton‘s 2013 ($148.50) had plenty of structure with only just a bit of savoury character; one of the wines tonight that seemed particularly closed, and young, with, for now, #nopersonality. Time time time.  I’ve never had a Château d’Armailhac I’ve ever wanted to gush over, to be honest, and I’m not sure why. Must be a combination of mismatching expectations and average vintages that I’ve had the pleasure of tasting. The fifth growth’s 2013 ($78) clearly needs some loosening, but we’ve finally reached a clear unarguable presence of herbier green pepper, blackcurrant, and blackberry. It’s not super unyielding, but some spicy peppery black fruit shows through the chain mail. The story goes that the second growth Château Pichon-Longueville was shadowed by other second growths, blooming in quality only when the late 1980s hit due to new ownership and super large investments. Today they’ve most certainly caught up with all the other châteaux in its class, the 2013 providing another indulgent style with lots of new oak at 20 months. Tannin and structure is finer compared to some of the other wines, and there’s a whiff of cologne-like aromatics in front of the black fruit. Oz Clarke says that Château de Pez has been “long regarded as the appellation’s leading non-classified growth”. I believe it, and I’m looking forward to (re)trying wines of this château. The 2013 mainly consisted of some char and cassis-driven fruit, with solid structure giving way to a fair amount of punch. A bit dull from what I remember; maybe this needs time, or maybe it’s just average this time around. Much more concentrated compared to the previous, Château Phélan Ségur‘s 2013 was fairly young and punchy with its bits of discernible black fruit. The 2010 in comparison had much more of an open-knit personality with some red pepper, oak, and spicy fruit. The former is still very very tight but has lots of potential, just like me when I",

For me, it’s just the fact that the intrinsic acid of Champagne can often be too zippy for me. Complexities derived from the traditional method of sparkling wine add legitimate and intricate bready, yeasty, and biscuity tones, but the price usually (and personally, most importantly) doesn’t justify it for me. Cava is usually the answer to my complaint, with grapes that have naturally lower acidity, can derive some similar autolytic and rubbery notes with production, and I don’t have to dab my wallet with paper towels every time it begins to cry. Speaking of crying, here’s a picture of rich kids pouring Champagne all over their gold watches. WHY?!?!?!?!?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! YOUR PARENTS MUST BE SOOO PROUD Ahem. I’m usually not a fan of Blanc de Blancs, as Chardonnay can give a lighter-bodied character, as opposed to the heavier Pinot Noir in sparkling wine. That being said, this wine has enough age that it evolved with those autolytic notes, and the acidity has rounded out beautifully while still retaining zip.

The finish was slightly clunky, where there was a hint of a funky metallic thing going on, but overall I was quite pleased. One of my most memorable moments with Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon (well, my only perhaps) was during a weekly tasting as part of the FNH 330 (Wine Appreciation) course at UBC, years ago, where the professor had the TAs pour us a Cabernet Sauvignon. It was from Chile, purportedly, but I sent out some e-mails and found out that the professor had blended a Chilean Cab (“too oaky and lacking some fruit”) with a Coonawarra Cab (“too fruity and lacking some oak”). Barely forgivable, in my opinion, especially after another student said he smelt eucalyptus in his wine, and then was shot down by the TA, followed by light mocking from other students: but anyone who’s familiar with Coonawarra Cab knows that eucalyptus is a benchmark aroma. I understand that the prof wanted to find a pure expression of Cab, but I think that was a contrived and ridiculous method of doing it, especially for a product that’s so based in its origins. And damn, that one student had a pretty good nose. Ha. I’m not sure what the point of that story was, besides to point out a story that included Coonawarra Cab and maybe an excuse to complain about random things, but I did lead a guest lecture at UBC on wine in this past week, so I’ve done my counter-duty to get students excited about wine. Huzzah! Wynns also makes a regular Cabernet Sauvignon that recently switched over from the 2008 vintage to the 2012 vintage. The 2008 was fantastic at the low 30-dollar price point and I would definitely suggest snatching up whatever bottles you can find.",

I don’t recall ever trying one (let alone a vintage Champagne-style bubbly) so I thought I’d give it a go. Basic stuff at first. Medium lemon, obvious froth upon pouring. I was disappointed in the fact that I detected little to no autolytic notes, though. All I got on the restrained nose was some flinty green and citrus fruits. What swayed my slight disappointment were the persistent creamy bubbles, adding body to a wine that would otherwise be boring. The acid was lively, and the length was good. I’d be interested to see what age would do to this wine, although I feel like it doesn’t even have enough oomph to begin with – to develop. All in all, this was a wine of questionable value that was, however, a great example of that mousse-y quality that a lot of cheap bubblys don’t have. The rosé of the same producer is getting a lot of buzz at the place I’m working at, so I’m looking forward to snagging myself a bottle of that when I get the chance. At 30 dollars, the value of the wine is questionable – we seem to be getting a decent amount of feedback from the rosé which is a couple bucks cheaper.

Welcome back to the onslaught of me guessing all these blind tasted wines are from Chile, like the mother who constantly guesses your taste of the opposite gender. Ha. HA. As I said, the instructor accidentally flashed the identity of the wine on the slideshow – and then switched the order of the wines (without us knowing) to at least mix it up. The only thing I saw on the screen was “Merlot” (it was really “Cabernet Merlot” – bah) so the whole time I was essentially trying to guess where this “Merlot” was from. Initially I thought this had to be from the New World. The texture of the wine was quite lush, and although the components that the instructor got (e.g. med+ acid, med+ tannin) pointed to a stronger structure, my original assessment had both on medium, but this could very well have been the “Merlot” priming. Gah. That being said, 2009 was a ripe year with good concentration. Other recent examples have shown similar patterns, and this was no exception, although I could’ve sworn that the Château Potensac we had a couple of weeks ago showed higher levels of tannin. Bah. I’m tired. I need more rest before these stressful bouts of… sitting down and tasting wine. Wow, okay. Could this age? My first impressions say no: my purported assessment of a medium structure and balance of primary and secondary characteristics say drink now, but the apparent structure, rougher tannins, and good concentration tell me that a couple of years could do a thing or two.

      "description": "We WILL outdrink you. And destroy you. Whichever order results in better background music. :) Long-ass day. Doesn’t seem so bad in retrospect, but I woke up early for a 9AM thing at UBC, took the 99 to the last stop for work, and then needed to travel all the way back to UBC to lead Part 2 of the sort-of-intro-to-wine themed tasting, all while wearing pants that weren’t jeans, one of those shirts you’d hate to spill wine on, and shoes that didn’t fit just enough to make my feet cry. The garb was fitting for all of the day’s events but for this day in particular, I would defs have lead a wine tasting wearing nothing but seven layers of random comfortable 7-foot-long linens, cinnamon-bun-Homer-Simpson style. I was that uncomfortable (ugh rain + sickness). Except I’ve watched enough Project Runway to know that I’d be judged by someone with a German accent. Walk of shame out of the room from elimination. America’s Next Top Wine Tasting? legit For this tasting we tried a French Sauvignon Blanc, an Argentinian Syrah, a Rosé Crémant from Burgundy, and an Italian Brachetto. The former two because they were the noble grapes we hadn’t discussed yet, and the latter two because they were fun and why not. Yay! Along with that whole idea of matching up grape varieties with personalities: Sauvignon Blanc reminds me of an outdoorsy person, and Syrah/Shiraz, the mysterious one. These are probably one of my more fitting comparisons, seeing as Sauvignon Blanc typically has grassy and citrus notes, while Syrah can have red fruit, black fruit, but with a common touch of smokiness or black pepper. Back when one of my best friends bought me a bottle of Syrah for my birthday, I decided to write my first tasting note, knowing jack shit about wine. One of the first things I wrote was “campfire”, which I learned wasn’t totally off. Sauvignon Blanc, while seemingly specific in its characteristics, can definitely vary in character. Razor sharp and mineral-driven versions can be found in the Loire (which I call home to the hipster grape varieties in France), along with mellower versions around Bordeaux, some of which bridge the Old World-New World styles. New Zealand and Chile are examples of notable and amazing regions in which Sauv Blanc can be produced in that aromatic, grassy, and outgoing style opposed to the more elegant and almost furtive style of the Old World. Generally a great seafood pairing, for sure. True story Other things that happened (and which you should feel bad for missing out on) included me eventually succeeding at sabring a bottle of Crémant (hence the title), some kind of grape-eating game, and a push-up contest. It was fun, but I’m not even sure if most of that happened and perhaps the alcohol and long day combined to give me Freudian hallucinations. (Oh well.) AND bread(crumbs)!   Okay, so I lied. This wine is not Sauv Blanc dominated but has other grapes like Colombard and Ugni Blanc, both which provide body and a fruitiness that is reminiscent of a New World wine but still made in that Old World style. Dry, medium-bodied, medium+ acidity, and aromas of grapefruit, citrus, and someone else pointed out that they got pineapple, which is normally weird to get out of Sauvignon Blanc but not out of the question because of the random slosh of grapes thrown into this wine. I also heard honey which I totally see as well. I can see this going well with seafood, but I can also see this going well with a failed midterm and a subpar subsequent pep talk. 15 buckaroos is good for this wine.   This was an interesting one. Definitely fruitier than I expected, but still had that Syrah smokiness. Common descriptors included raspberry, black cherry, and coffee, all which I was proud to hear. Definitely bridges the Old World-New World style much in the same way that the first wine does. Dry, medium-bodied, medium to medium+ acidity, medium tannins. I think. Meatier for sure – I wish the length was a bit longer on this, but otherwise this ain’t bad for 17 bones.   I’m known at work for being a rosé-hater. Confession: I don’t know – when I want a rosé – I do, more than half the wine, want a fruity rosé, and not that savoury shit you get out of most serious rosés like this one. I can’t help it – to me, pink shouts fun and almost into that  off-dry territory, and I psychologically expect that. That being said, this wine super good for its category, and had great light red fruit notes along with that savoury and long finish. Also, this was the point in time where I started paying less and less attention to tasting notes. 27 dollars and very French. Great bubbs. Fantastic value for celebration. 4) NV Toso Brachetto d’Acqui  This was a popular one. Sparkling sweet red – lower in alcohol, probably as a result of an interrupted fermentation (or maybe the Asti method). Quite similar to Moscato with a red fruit kick – almost similar to Lambrusco (in theory – I’ve never had one). Things I heard included strawberries, raspberries, cranberry juice, and raisins. So yeah – basically red sweet fruit on the nose and that dried jammy fruit character on the palate, especially on the finish. Medium-sweet to sweet and medium-bodied, but had a rather low acidity which was thankfully uplifted by some of the sparkle to prevent that cloying character. Quite popular with the group and it’s weird to see the huge general contrast in tastes to people that I serve at the wine store. 20 bucks. But yeah! That’s it for this tasting. For the next session, we’re trying wines that pair with a zombie apocalypse. Good for the souuullll hah",

The White Swan i.e. Nina Sayers comes to mind, where perfection is bitingly found but the wine is almost too young and needs lots of time to develop. Crisp notes of mineral, green apple, pear, a hint of oak (purportedly), cream, and something reminiscent to Loire Chenin that’s very wool and mushroom-like are found on the nose, and the palate reverberates the flavours with more intensity. There’s a beautiful juxtaposition of young richness and brisk acid; a concentration of flavours that have lots of finesse. The flavours also last quite long on the palate, and it’ll be exciting to see how this develops over the next couple of years.

I assume that they’re still doing well now, but not as good as before. I often get Chardonnay and Pinot Gris mixed up, but a little oak always screws me up.

I’m shameless, and the best customers join me. Like this song! I’m sometimes a bit harsh with Prosecco, because it’s difficult when you detect that bit of sugar in sweeter versions. You then have to align and map the sweetness along with the obvious Prosecco-ness against the acidity, concentration, and other flavours while determining the quality. I underestimated both the Prosecco we had weeks ago along with this one. This is the second-ever wine I’ve had from Adami and it was an example of a fantastic off-dry Prosecco. Though I prefer Adami’s Extra Dry for better balance, the producer as a whole makes fantastic examples of higher-quality Prosecco. There was a bit of a discussion where it’s generally accepted that Prosecco will almost never be prodigiously complex, and we find that it’s almost always dominated mostly by its green apple and ripe pear fruit, complemented by the mineral tones and other fruits at its best. So at the top, where the best Prosecchi battle, we not only judge them by their small edges of complexity, but mostly – I find – by mouthfeel, balance, and concentration. And it’s tough.

Barbera tends to be a bit of a happier, easy-going grape variety – generally, its low tannins are matched with a high acidity, and concentrated red fruit and smoky flavours from possible oak join in the mix. This is the general recipe, though, especially with Barbera d’Asti, which tends to be softer and more supple. Barbera d’Alba is the stronger and perhaps eviler twin of the two main Barbera, with much more power and darkness. I’m not sure with this wine. I always say this – but maybe it’s because I’m not drinking Barbera enough (or perhaps this is typical Barbera d’Alba) – the wine almost tastes like Barbera is moving towards the brink of evil. The spice and smoke on the nose dominate the dried fruit on the nose, and the acidity makes sure that you know its there with a tart kick at the back palate. The alcohol also makes itself present. That being said, the ripe tannins are woven in quite nicely, and the balance itself is  generally good. I would elaborate but I found the bottle empty the next morning. Eh, well.

My eyebrows were raised and my lips were pursed as soon as I saw the pale salmon poured from the bottle, and I gave it a sniff with a confirmed nod. Yes, I am that asshole (with traditional method sparkling rosés), and I’ve always been wary of them ever since my first exposure. I’m watching you, TMSRs! (This reminded me a lot of the NV Lugny Crémant de Bourgogne Rosé, and I thought it was at first. Hence the guess.) I may have mentioned it in a previous post, but traditionally-made sparkling rosé is a bit of a liquid sphinx. Phenolics from red grape skins somehow cancel out the majority of toasty autolytic character (even if just a small portion of the cuvée), and you’re left with the replacement delicate red fruit notes, some of the typical pomaceous fruit, the creamy mousse, and austere structure. But combine this with the fact that producers sometimes struggle to be consistent with colour and style every year, and it almost doesn’t make sense to me that top dollar goes to something so non-autolytic and relatively delicate and light like rosé Champagne. On one point, it sort of makes sense because alternatives can really be ferocious, with the cherry and cranberry-scented rosé Cavas that might don brutish bubbles and sometimes less balance to boot. So rosé Champagnes do intrigue me the most (as do the people that drink them more regularly than the common peasant, like me), but then again, I guess that’s where the better-valued rosé Crémants come in. I suppose I’m not being fair to the light and feathery still wines of the world that also command dolla billz, like the delicious Chablis and Sancerre of the world, but I do think that Chablis and Sancerre can more often be done with concentration and tacit vigour, where I’ve run into some sparkling rosés where strength only lies in the easy and quick-dissipating mousse which doesn’t live for very long. I have yet to taste a rosé Champagne that really sweeps me off my feet with anything more than light featheriness. That being said, the instructor stated that some rosé Crémants can easily be confused with that of the Champagne variety and also empathized with those who guessed this as rosé Champagne. This was slightly more intense than the Lugny rosé, though maybe I was too harsh with the Lugny to begin with. There was a feathery finesse to the wine, and though the palate was a bit more intense than the nose, I felt like there was still a lack in focus and intensity throughout.

Along with spice, there are plummy farmyard aromas, dried red and black fruits, and a strong dusting of dark chocolate. A liquid black forest cake. The palate isn’t exactly as viscous as you would expect for a higher-proofed wine, but the velvety juicy body is eventually shooed away by the flexed muscle tannins, and I suppose that’s generally expected for an Italian red. The complex flavours are a bit more muted on the palate as a result, and something tells me this could age. So, an edit: a liquid black forest cake but with chunks of bear-shaped bark. It’s sort of like those scenes in Game of Thrones (season 4 spoilers!) that revolve around The Hound, who’s this big and scary (yet pretty badass) guy with half of a real face, but now and then he has these sort-of fuzzy soul scenes between either Sansa Stark or Arya Stark that either make you roll your eyes or make him more of a likeable character (or both). Which just means he’s probably going to eventually die anyways. Thanks, author.  But it’s pretty cool, because I hardly find any Merlot that dares to be some form of rough. The wine does find some sort of balance between tannin and fruit. If the fruit on the palate still feels slightly locked away, I can’t imagine how this would taste when it was first released. It feels like there’s fur growing  on the inside of my mouth. And despite 15% ABV, the wine is impressively balanced. It’s macho, velvety, and rough, all in one go.",

      "description": "This wine serves to be a bit of a delicious double-edged sword for me at the moment. I’ve been craving an off-dry no-nonsense drink-all-of-me wine since the rainy morning. And I was doing so well for not having had a drink for two days in a row, but here I am. (Third time’s a charm?) I’m also supposed to be doing WSET Diploma exam preparation for the sparkling and fortified units which takes place in June – and this isn’t even a sparkling or fortified wine so I can’t even use that excuse, nor will I have the willing sobriety to even study after a good fifteen minutes of consuming even a bit of this wine. But I’m convincing myself that this is a nice excuse to study a bit of Pinot Meunier, the understudy of the three main grapes in Champagne. So there. The wine is whimsical in both theory and taste. Pinot Meunier is not a grape you typically see by itself in its lonesome blatant youthful character. In sparkling wines (e.g. Champagne), it mostly serves to contribute some form of youthful upfront fruit which isn’t really meant to age for super long periods, sort of like how casual Fridays attempt to make the workweek a little less austere, or how the drunk uncle might spice up a positively boring wedding. This rosé captures Pinot Meunier’s playful, soft, and unpretentious nature, displaying melodies of mostly strawberries, rhubarb, and some floral character. A hint of spritz on the palate. Pair with Oh Land’s “White Nights”, to which this wine would dance if it were a person. The wine almost veers into gummy bear territory, but the intensity of the flavours on the palate balance it out. I suppose the wine could have a bit more structure and finesse, but perhaps we would also lose its Seussian nature. It does have a bit of sweetness and candor, but it has enough depth to be a wine worth raving about. This wine is bringing me summer sun when Vancouver is only bringing me rain.

As if “earthy” and “mineral” weren’t strange enough to describe to people, we arrive at a wine that’s so weird – yet so classic – that it’s bound to split people in the middle like the burning tire and ash-scented South African Pinotage. Savennières is an appellation from the Loire Valley in France that produces dry, concentrated, and fundamentally non-fruity wines from Chenin Blanc, and Baumard makes exceptional and superlative examples described by Jancis Robinson as “a wine for intellectuals, not neophytes.” That’s the most shade I’ve ever seen anyone throw from within an encyclopedia. It’s one of those wines that’s hard to put into words: so much, that it almost sounds disgusting on paper, but experiencing the wine – without sounding too ridiculous about it – really is sort of otherworldly. Not in a superficial spiritual sense, but in a way where you’re questioning how the fuck a wine could smell and taste like cream of mushroom soup. I understand the wasabi note that manifests itself from the mineral, wet wool, and savoury notes you typically get from dry Loire Chenin Blanc. It’s just much more concentrated here, with fruit playing second or even third fiddle, the nose posing much more wet wool in its place, and to a lesser extent, cream of mushroom and slightly oxidative scents. It’s a wine that’s apparently undrinkable in its youth and takes years and years for it to even blossom, and I believe it, but I wonder how much faith and time it took to figure out the secrets of dry aged Chenin. It’s like the Feebas-Milotic of wine, and if you understood that, that’s all you really need to know. The palate is full-bodied, but the wine isn’t as high in acid as I expected for a Savennières that’s relatively early in its journey. The alcohol is a bit evident on the finish, but can be forgiven with the lush and developing flavours of cream, mushroom, and mineral on the palate. The wine’s center is quite savoury and it ends slightly bitter and floral, but they intertwine with the hints of mushroom and mineral flavours well onto a long finish. During some research, I now understand the common tasting note of there being some lack of uplift. Andrew Jefford describes this particular wine as one that “[rivals] Corton-Charlemagne and Montrachet; dense, glycerous and flavor saturated packed with honey nuts and flowers.” I can’t say whether or not this is an exaggeration because I haven’t had my fair shares of Corton-Charlemagne or Montrachet (you can’t spell Montrachet without ratchet! *slow clap*), but I can say with certainty that this is pretty damn good for half or a third of the price of the purported Burgundian counterparts. Liquid mushrooms, wet wool, wasabi, and stones never tasted so delicious. But only if you’re not a n00b, according to Jancis.",

This class beat me to the punch, but it’s not like I’m complaining. I could tell that I was in for a ride by the first sniff. But really, “ride” could, at both end of the spectrums, designate either a fun roller coaster ride or really bad sex. Like really bad, like two cardboard puzzle pieces that won’t fit and you have to force them together only to realize hey that piece doesn’t go there! I expected the latter (woo!), but chances are always to be given. And they need to be formally written down to shame certain bottles of wine. The first sniffs were an all-too-familiar estery gift box stemming from cooler fermentation temperatures. Candied pear, apple, bubble gum, and a bit of banana exploded into my nose (not literally) with a hint of an unripe greenish character. Acidity on the palate for wines like this is key, because it acts as the broom that sweeps up the food fight. That wasn’t the case in this wine, and there was a bit of a slight cloy to the palate which is an ironically difficult feat considering the short length. A quick and simple, in-and-out party that no one helped clean up. Bottles of wine like this are always a bit of a boring mystery, with grapes being sourced from who-knows-where in France. This wine, literally, has gotten around. You know? I promise that I won’t judge you if this is your jam, but I hope you know that you’re drinking a bottle of quick and awkward sex.

I’m not entirely sure that it shares much similarity to other aged vintage ports that I’ve tried in the past (then again that number isn’t particularly high to begin with), with main notes comprising of this baked and stewed fruit sort of note. There was also this interesting menthol-like pyrazine herbal character which I wasn’t sure that I was actually smelling, combined with tertiary oxidative notes. Non-flavour components were much more in-tune with each other compared to the next wine in the flight (which was a young 2011), with alcohol, acid, and tannin being rather present but much more woven together. Texture was much broader and less intense and piercing, while flavour components also shifted from the intense infatuated syrupy black fruit into a relaxed spread of evolved flavours. Taming the fiery components to make lovely, lovely, lovely smoked tinder. Ugh, Tinder. Happy Valentine’s Day, y’all! This is the general recipe for aged port, though I would argue that this particular bottle was either at its peak or slightly past it. There was just something about the fruits that seemed almost too awkwardly cooked, and the wine overall seemed like it lacked some sort of vibrance and finesse. Though port is supposed to be long-lived, it seems that other tasting notes regarding its age seem to match up with mine – Richard Hemming drank this in 2010 and predicted drinkability to 2014, while Jancis Robinson tasted this in 2005 and predicted drinkability to 2018.

I remember having an entire bottle one holiday (Thanksgiving 2011? 2012? Christmas?). I retried the same bottle during a Youtube proposal video marathon and hair-dyeing session (not mine, obviously) with a close friend one night, only to realize I drank an entire bottle of corked wine on that one previous holiday. I thought the style of that particular bottle was simply lower in fruit and weirdly high and imbalanced on the “earth” aspect, but I missed all the glittery raspberry jam goodness that pairs nicely with weird yet charming dance mobs. And hair dye. I’m sure I would’ve finished the bottle had I known, anyways. I’m sure beer was also involved, but it’s hard to remember these things – I vaguely remember spilling a basket of mail and coins down a flight of stairs. I’m clumsy when I’m sober, so you can imagine the shit that stirs when I ruin the chemical equilibrium in my bloodstream. This particular Lambrusco had deep and dark berry jam notes, with hints of dark chocolate, earth, cassis, and weirdly enough – apple (reminding me of some Marechal Foch I’ve had. Maybe malic acid notes?). The palate was similar, with a surprising amount of acid to balance the ripe dark fruit, along with a delicate mousse. This wine is a bit of a trickster, and I was led to believe that it was heavier than it actually was. Thus I guessed sparkling Shiraz like a doofus. I enjoy disjointedly enigmatic yet playfully non-serious wines like this. Dark tones contrast with the light-footed fizz and bright acid. Pair with Haim’s “Falling”, which seems just as melancholic yet upbeat, and quick yet marked.",

Plus, a warmer climate implies lower acidity with riper fruit, and that’s exactly want I want right now. A liquid pillow in my mouth. Soon: my head on an actual pillow, and dreams about happy things, like love and Champagne. Pillowy it is. Lower acid gives way to riper fruit and a palate that’s almost off-dry but not quite; baked pear dominates the flavours, with hints of slightly caramelized banana and pineapple in the background. It’s slightly creamy, which is nice – but not blousy by any means – and there’s a sprinkle and a half of minerality as well. I dig it, especially at the nice price point.",

      "description": "Well, here we are. Around ten days left until the terrifying WSET Diploma Unit 5 + 6 exams. After piling through a decent amount of flash cards, I decided I deserved wine. That and I’ve also been cooped up in the house for more than 24 hours and decided that a walk to the liquor store would be sufficient exercise – which obviously it wasn’t – but let’s pretend it was. I’ve been so lazy and partially sick – so most of my day (besides studying) consisted of watching videos on the new Super Smash Bros game and it’s all I have on my mind right now. My wine budget will probably have to shift in favour for video games, and I’m absolutely looking forward to it. I decided to time myself while writing a tasting note today, since we have a mere hour per unit exam to taste 3 wines, describe our conclusions, and then write literally all we know on three other randomly selected topics. I clocked in at just over five minutes with this wine, but that’s knowing it open label. Wrestling with identity during the exam is going to absolutely fucking SLAY me, and I’m definitely going to be literally scribbling notes until the last second. Huzzah! But the wine: definitely that clean crémant style that I’m often terrified that I won’t be able to identify in a blind setting, just because the crémants I’ve come across tend to be almost too clean. Though there are hints of it in this wine (perhaps by the power of suggestion), I do detect the slight yeastiness of the traditional method, but the wine is mostly an gently austere frame of green apples, lemon zest, stone fruit, and this savoury ribbon of citrus zest on the finish. It’s a bit easier to detect when the bubbles dissipate, but there’s just a mere bit of sweetness which rounds out the high acid and adds a bit of charm. It’s elegant and light-footed. And the wine has a fucking fairy on the label, which makes me wonder why I haven’t bought this sooner.

Being a thin-skinned grape variety with lots of flesh, it produces lighter-coloured wines with lower tannins but can still produce a wine with a considerable amount of body and alcohol – although in drought and in hotter conditions, thicker skins and a deeper colour aren’t unknown (like this wine), but all in all, this wine tends to oxidize quickly; read – drink most of these wines young. It looks like there was a typo on our sheet – the online BC Liquor store website lists this as around $20 – our sheet says $28. Very surprising, and a much better value. Oz Clarke lists Bodegas Borsao’s other Garnacha as a recommended wine to try (which is 5 dollars cheaper than this one), so now I’m curious. The wine itself was delicious. Fruity, and a bit more residual sugar despite being dry: my tongue finally has something to play around with and analyze something here. The wine was smooth and unobtrusive from modest structural components, and the high alcohol was well-balanced. I’m adding Garnacha to the summer evening list. Also definitely a grape to introduce to the newer drinkers who aren’t down with any big and furry grizzly bear tannins yet – for the most part. I’ve read about the idea that a Garnacha with lower tannins can pair well with mild curries. I always thought that the high alcohol would ruin the match – but that’s definitely something I have to try. Willingly. Garnacha is one of those grapes I picture Game of Thrones characters drinking when I see goblets on screen. Fruity, alcoholic, and in an aerobic winemaking style. Glug.",

I’ve never loved a wine that Petite Sirah has touched – it’s not unusual to find this in a jammy (and sometimes confected or even off-dry) Californian Red; more than a few examples have been enough to condition me away from it. How dangerous.  Courageous hipster grape evangelizers like Jennifer-Simonetti Bryan MW (who recommends the Bogle Petite Sirah in so many of her articles and interviews) always kept my mind open. To me, Petite Sirah is to Zinfandel and Syrah as Pinot Blanc is to Chardonnay and Pinot Gris – there are some common links, but the latter grape lives in the shadows and the good (and apparently sometimes long-lived, for Petite Sirah) examples of the grape can be tough to find in some markets – but they exist, and they are justifiably good. Back to the grape analogy – Petite Sirah has that baked fruit characteristic that you might find in a grape like Zinfandel, but can still have more structured mouthfeel which is more akin to Syrah. This wine is a good example of a sub-20 version: baked red and black fruit supported by vanilla and cloves. The palate echoes the flavours, but the structure might be deceiving for those who expect a texture as soft and easy as the jam flavours: instead, a large amount of ripe tannins and a well-balanced acidity structure out the wine, but the finish is a little imbalanced. There is a slight bitter attack and a bit of a persistence of such flavouring throughout, but it’s inoffensive and generally contributes to a rougher character. I do say that this is good value, but there is the caveat that people who like these wines usually pay around this much for these styles of wines, anyways. This is not for the Old World worshippers, nor the people looking for a bottle of elegance. For some reason, this is exactly the kind of wine I picture Game of Thrones characters drinking on the show. And I drool and get jealous, which is why I bought this wine. (Although watching the show, their winemaking methods would seem aerobic and oxidized to me – perhaps more Spanish in character.)",

That and I legitimately cannot remember the last time I consciously bought a Bordeaux only because I’m afraid of them at the so-called “moderate” or “everyday” price point. I decided a half-bottle was less risky. There’s the disclaimer that I’m drinking this without any form of decanting, because it’s midnight and I want to drink. Suck it. The wine has a distinct profile that I haven’t smelled in a while. Despite the fact that the wine is heavily dominated by Merlot compared to Cab (90/10), there’s a distinct blackcurrant character that reminds me of – and maybe it’s because I have beer on the mind – a vaguely similar blackcurrant note that I’ve had in beer (more specifically, the Driftwood Lustrum Anniversary Sour Ale, if you cared enough to wonder). Merlot manifests itself with dark cherry and dark plum notes. Only a mere hint of oak on the nose is confirmed by the spec sheet – the wine has only seen 20% of itself in French oak. The palate isn’t as revealing, but it’s starting to open up in the glass – the plummy character hides behind some earthy tannin and some woody spice. The acid isn’t as high as I thought it would be which is sort of nice for an after-work unwinder, but what’s impressive is the persistent and earthy finish. I’d definitely love to see how this wine would develop with age. (And though half-bottles age faster than their normal counterparts due to the greater wine-to-cork (and therefore oxygen) contact, I can’t say this would differ too much than the full bottle at the current moment because these particular wines have only been bottled in 2012.) Bordeaux – even in Merlot-dominated forms like this – can be pretty muscly. This wine is pretty big and mainstream like a jock, but has a plush centre.

I’ve been dying to retry wines that I’ve had further back in my wine education (especially if it was more than a year ago) just to see whether or not my palate is consistent, and whether or not I pick up on the same notes. Obviously I knew less things about wine back then, so it’s interesting to compare that disconnect. You know the crowd who likes Yellowtail? This wine almost exemplifies the extreme opposite. Whereas the Yellowtail crowd enjoys the confected and overripe fruit that the brand produces (not that there’s anything wrong with that!), this wine is almost devoid of any real character, hardly even exuding any minerality. The palate is the same, but displays a bit of savoury character that draws out the finish. I’m mostly surprised that I’ve deemed this as “very good quality” in the past, even comparing it to having some rosé Champagne similarities. And it made sense, because people loved this, and they still do. The last time I’ve had this, I also called everything more intense than it was. The aromas and flavours are really hard to look for in this wine, and the strength definitely lies in the structure. The bubbles are mouth-filling (yet just a touch abrasive), the wine has a juicy + savoury minerality, and there’s an evident bit of dosage the rounds out the palate even more. Otherwise – flawed bottle? Improper storage? Bottle variation?  Beautiful label, but there’s really nothing there, like Karen Smith from “Mean Girls”. It shocked me when I read that Tom Stevenson (in the new edition of the World Encyclopedia of Champagne & Sparkling Wine) rated this particular winery with a mere average of 70 points (= “the point at which any sparkling wine other than Champagne starts to become interesting”), describing Lugny’s wines as generally “fruit driven, but all too often it is just the aroma that is fruity, and the wines lack fruit and finesse on the palate”. It’s disheartens me to say that I understand why he says this, but at the same time, it’s an interesting example of how that might not even matter in practice. Just like how Yellowtail sold despite the cries of the wine aficionados, I would say without a doubt that this particular wine is one of the best-selling of its kind in the store. People favour its dryness, structure, and simplicity. Literally almost everyone who buys this, loves this. I’m kind of scared now. I’m really hoping that this was just a flawed bottle, though.

I was pleasantly surprised when the new vintage wriggled its way into my life, swimming past my doubt and into the pleasure portions of my brain, so I definitely had to buy a bottle. But mostly because I had nothing to drink yesterday and I have to make up for that, like now. The wine returns to its glory this vintage, with soft pear, lime, and white flowers gliding from the glass, providing a little more intensity on the palate. There’s only a minor suggestion at autolysis as the wine warms up, unfortunately, but the wine’s strength lies in its balance and fruit, providing just enough acidity and lift to let the ripe fruit show through.

Beautiful deep lemon colour, coupled by an interesting nose quite reminiscent of a Vouvray I tried a couple weeks back. Instead, though, the honey and woodier spices were more pronounced, with the fruit taking a bit more of the back seat role in the vehicle that was this wine. Oh man. My analogies. Oxidative notes were present and integrated well with the spice notes. So like, the middle seat of the van. Or the front compartment where you keep your licence and registration.  The palate was really interesting, and the sweetness is really hard to peg. The wine begins with this sweetness, but quickly becomes overtaken by this streak of bitterness and slight acidity that takes over the palate and has this two-toned sort of personality. You sort of get that teasing quality, but it’s more of that alluring sweetness that gradually falls into that bitter badass quality. Very Saoirse Ronan from Hanna. lol my analogies. The body is heavy and has that slightly oily mouthfeel, with just enough acidity to have good structure. After tasting this wine, it reminded me more of a couple (very good value) Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc wines I’ve had in the past, which, while sweet, still had that bitterness to back up the sweetness. Although not Chenin Blanc, I did guess an Old World wine.\nGermany? False.\nFrance? Correct.\n(“Germany wasn’t too far off…”)\nAlsace? Correct. Then I guessed a whole crapload of grapes until I got to Pinot Gris, which surprised me, not only because I’m not a big fan of Pinot Gris, but because I didn’t realize Pinot Gris could have such a distinct character and personality (even though I guess it did remind me of a lot of other wines I’ve had). Like the 2005 Champalou Vouvray, I’d like to (and am afraid to) see what more age can do to this wine, although it’s wonderful as it is right now. I’m going to shamelessly brag that I guessed one year off of the actual vintage  This was delicious, and would maybe make for a great gift, but I can definitely say that there are similar wines that are lesser wallet destroyers, although this was a great example of what Pinot Gris can do.

If you were wondering. Enter part 2! We still have toast on the breakfast menu for this wine, but toss in some smoky peppered bacon and toast with blackberry jam. And then replace the citrus marmalade with something leathery. (Or something.) The appellation from which this wine comes is the northernmost tip of the Rhône, where gravelly soils extend from Beaujolais. Viticulture is almost as expensive as it gets, with low yields and sloped vineyards, leading to necessary terraces and obligatory manual harvesting. Like Condrieu to the south, plantings were relatively low as recent as the 60s and 70s but boomed in the 90s, in this case, due to Guigal and Robert Parker. The wines from this region are allowed a maximum of 20 percent Viognier to be co-fermented into the wine, which adds aromatic lift and counter-intuitively deepens the colour, though we rarely see anything from this region but wines made of pure Syrah. Ironically, I’m pretty sure it was Côte-Rôtie that spurred the subsequent blends of Syrah/Shiraz and Viognier found in other wine regions, like that one time I visited Laughing Stock Vineyards in the Okanagan and tasted a wine that was described of being in the style of Côte-Rôtie. Fantastic and outstanding. I can’t say I’ve had my generous share of pricey northern Rhône wines, but apparently this drinks similarly to a top-notch Hermitage or Cornas from the opposite end of the northern Rhône.

And then I had it in class again – and I thought the wine was fantastic all three times. Besides the change from “Old Vines” to “Vieilles Vignes”, I’m stoked that my tasting notes were generally in the same camp. The first time around we were given 5 white wines to match with 5 different grape varieties so Chenin Blanc was basically a given, but this time around it was a little tougher. I mean, you smell heavy oak and baked apple on the nose with that identical echo on the palate, and you immediately think new world oaked Chardonnay. You just do. Even if you’re a super advanced taster and you knew it wasn’t new world oaked Chardonnay, the thought has to have at least crossed your mind. It’s like you see that one haughty scarf-wearing guy in the lineup one October when you’re in the line for Starbucks, and it’s like “this bitch is definitely going to order a Pumpkin Spice Latte and I bet he has an unforgivingly difficult hipster name for the barista to write on the cup”. And even if he orders a grande dark roast and his name is Tom, you’re like “I bet this bitch enjoys them anyways”. The South African style of Chenin Blanc tends towards the riper and powerful driven examples opposed to the tight Loire versions that can take years to open up. There’s almost a parallel with new world oaked Chardonnays and tight white Burgundy. And so I and whoever read their notes out for this definitely thought this was Chardonnay, but the key factor is the acid, something which Chenin Blanc is naturally high in. It’s a nice alternative to a Chardonnay that might be better for a versatile food pairing (Thanksgiving, hint hint), and you still get that meaty texture for a white and that baked apple character, but with a frame of acid that keeps it fresh. Speaking of Pumpkin Spice Lattes and Thanksgiving – this is a superb autumn wine which combines the weightier warmth in a cooler season and some cozy baking spice. It’s no wonder why Pumpkin Spice Lattes are such a huge thing at this time of year, and I suppose it’ll take South African Chenin Blanc years before it equates to such a thing, and I hope that it eventually does.",

I only remember having one in the past – Ca’ del Bosco (Cuvée Prestige), which is, I believe, the most well-known Franciacorta producer along with Bellavista. Unfortunately I don’t remember the nuances of the Ca’ del Bosco besides its toasty zippy goodness, mostly due to the fact that my coworkers and I were liver-deep in wine corkage, thanks to the event that was my birthday. It was a good night and I’m pretty sure I went to the Biltmore afterwards followed by a drunken feast at Lucy’s. There might have been some PBR somewhere during that night. So, for this WSET class, it was nice to try the traditional method Italian wine in a more sober environment. Heh. The wine was quite different from the two Champagnes in the previous flight – so different that I wasn’t sure what the wine was. Fruits were slightly riper and also somewhat stretched into the stone fruit camp, though subtle. There was an interesting mineral aspect on the nose, which was slightly earthy and smoky, but almost not quite – the classmate who read out her notes detected this as a lees sort of aroma, which made sense due to the fleshy and savoury palate. Notable is the acid, which is well-integrated and hidden behind concentration. I swore this was only medium acid, but apparently I’m also an incorrect doofus. I keep making dumb analogies to Naomi Campbell and Champagne, so let’s just call this one Erin O’Connor because it’s a much more quirky and understated traditionally-made sparkling. You can tell that I probably don’t do the most useful things in my free time. I promised myself I could open a half-bottle of Franciacorta if I did enough work today.

Sangiovese has much more tannin and scratch, though, while this was quite soft. I remember studying a bit of Pernand-Vergelesses mostly when committing Burgundy’s Côte d’Or to memory for the CMS Certified Sommelier exam, and my imprecise definition of the area is a mere blob of an appellation within the Savigny-lès-Beaune appellation in the Côte de Beaune. This region of the Côte d’Or is more known for its suppler and lighter reds (being more famous for its whites), and Pernand-Vergelesses has cooler east-facing slopes, perhaps manifesting its mesoclimate in the flinty red fruit of the wine, which certainly provided a contrast to the next two wines in the flight. I underestimated the quality of the wine – though some classmates insisted on longer length (I still swear on med or med+), I did admittedly miss some complexity (like oak, which is always tough for me in reds) that seemed to show more when isolated from the ripeness of the other two wines. I initially thought this was a regional Bourgogne Pinot Noir and I mistook elegance for a lack of concentration. It’s easy to do that, and easy to fall over that fence in Burgundy, where elegance and wateriness become a line as thin as a Riedel glass – and it’s even harder to tell when the flight of wines is so dynamic.",

I promised myself I wouldn’t spend more money on alcohol, let alone on a bottle that’s more than 30 dollars on the shelf for a lonely Friday night, but I really couldn’t help buying the new and hip bottle that recently made store status. Plus, I talked myself into how it can only help my wine education, since the upcoming WSET unit is sparkling (+ fortified)-centric, and sparkling (rosés) are so very holiday. Yesterday night I also hit this really weird and awkward negative mood (probably because of the snow?) and I decided I need a pick-me-up. A can of 2-dollar cider would have done the trick as well, but this way is much more fun. Apparently – and please correct me if I’m wrong – this is the first vintage that the sparkling rosé from Blue Mountain has ever hit the retail shelves because restaurants received all the allocations. So yay, I suppose. The wine’s strengths lie in the finesse, elegance, and balance.  Though there is traditional-method complexity there, it’s something you really have to search for on the nose. The palate is a little more intense, and there is a round expression of mineral, tart red fruit, and some savoury biscuity flavours. Balance and elegance are a bit tougher with sparkling wines. There’s something about the interaction of bubbles, acidity, and intensity that are an unexpected challenge, and we don’t realize how important they are until a wine badly misses the mark on one of the criteria. Though this wine’s aromas shy away, the structure is rounded out by the dosage and savoury character on the palate. I can understand how some people might see this wine as relatively simple, but at the same time, balance and finesse are often unappreciated. The understated yet expressive and quirky sparkle of the wine reminds me of Oh Land’s “White Nights”. But not the regular version – the relaxed Big Ugly Yellow Couch rendition.

Which is sort of like waking up to find that your kettle is broken. Not that important, but somehow, still fifty shades of shitty. So, our instructor disappeared for five minutes and sourced this bottle out from who knows where. Wahoo! Definitely New World on the nose. The upfront (yet elegant) red fruit gave it away, and I jumped to conclusions and headed straight to California as a guess. I missed a lot of the non-fruit components which I picked up afterwards, and New Zealand made much more sense. New Zealand Pinot has quite a distinctive fruity yet funky and spicy nose that can often be hard to miss (except when you’re me). Some noted that the Pinot vegetal and mushroom characteristics were a little more spoken on the palate. There was a little bit of well-integrated woody characteristics as well, and the fruit was concentrated – although the finish lacked a bit of balance. In terms of the umbrella of New Zealand, apparently wines from this region (Martinborough) will be the most Burgundian (which makes sense according to the analyses and conclusions of some classmates), with Central Otago having a distinct sage and darker character, and Marlborough being the lightest. So far (and to me), New Zealand  Pinot Noir generally falls between the Burgundian earth-driven styles and the fruit-driven Californian style, and this is a good example of that.",

We may or may not have a wine party either before or after said concert, and we may or may not open this to pair with the current royal fanfare of her highness. But we’re poor so maybe not. We’ll probably stick to Cava and fancy beer. Riiiight. My friend promises me that the concert will be fun, but all I can do is caress my liver while it cries in foreseen dread. Oh well! You’ve gotta pair the song to something as noble as Champagne along with the tension of high acidity. What’s unique about this wine – and perhaps why I pegged it as sparkling Vouvray – is the bit of residual sugar and ripeness that the wine has. Despite the flashy austerity, there is an extravagant display of riper pomaceous fruit along with moderate autolytic tones, a hint of honeyed nuts, and just a hint of funky mushroom and moss. In other words – a dress that Lady Gaga has yet to wear. I’m not used to a Champagne that’s higher in residual sugar like some people aren’t used to Lady Gaga – this wine has 20 g/L of sugar, where the standard for the typical Brut style usually contains 0-12 g/L. Perhaps this can serve to be an alternative to the more mass-produced brands of Champagne for the younger crowd that has a sweeter tooth. A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E. D-E-V-E-N-O-G-E. Ha!

I’m not a big fan of Pinot Grigio, and even recently, one of my newer co-workers and I excitedly burst into complete excitement into how we both disliked this particular variety. “Oh my God, you hate Pinot Grigio, too?!” It’s very middle-of-the-road and generally crowd-pleasing: its characteristics don’t seem to reach many extremes very often. Acidity, body, intensity, and so on, are usually kept in check, which perhaps gives the quaffable and enjoyable quality – unfortunately, this varietal seems to lack character at the same time, which I find happens in many Italian whites. On the other hand, there is a large crowd that this caters to, and that neutral, crisp, medium-everything characteristic wins over consumers who don’t like their wines to be dominated with fruit. These are the customers who firstly state that they don’t want a “sweet” wine, but half of the time I’m confident that they really mean “fruity”. That being said, I always like to suggest alternatives to people, just to broaden horizons. I’ll suggest a heavier Alsace Pinot Gris, for example, or perhaps a Portuguese Vinho Verde or Spanish Albariño. But there’s no doubt that Pinot Grigio is a very fashionable grape. My impressions of Pinot Grigio were probably muddled with over-negativity, because I was surprised that this wine in particular was of this grape. Although my mind wasn’t blown, I was slightly impressed by the nutty and floral complexity that this wine displayed, and this has been my go-to Pinot Grigio ever since even though that’s somewhat of a personal oxymoron (ha).",

I wasn’t sure whether or not the hint of peachiness in the wine was due to the red stains in the wine glasses we were using or because of some strangely coloured grape. Like Gewurztraminer. The nose was weird. I captured little to no fruit – just an ethanol-like spice, a slight neutral vanilla fruitiness, and neutral wood. Further smelling revealed a flutter of apples and more notably, nuts. Vague floral notes. Not aromatic. A generally restrained character, and I determined that it was Old World – no doubt that this wouldn’t be from the realm of the New. Two colleagues guessed Chenin – notes of wet wool and river stones were mentioned. Grüner, is that you? Maybe. Not enough acidity or life. Grüner is like that talkative friend. This wine is pretty closed. Similar on the palate: restrained yet round, but not oily. A mineral and a subtle tongue-coating citrus pith flavour almost cancels out the medium acidity, but isn’t cloying because there’s not much to cloy, except a slight alcohol warmth. The alcohol is not low. By no means did this wine seem anything that fit the diverse French moulds, nor the aromatic whites of Spain and Germany. Despite the lack in crispness, Italy seemed to be the one, with the all-neutral everything. Apparently correct. Looking back at my grape chart, guesses of Fiano or Falanghina (whatever the hell that is) probably would’ve been the closest (due to mere descriptions). My guesses started with Arneis, then trailed on to Vermentino, Verdicchio, Pinot Grigio, Trebbiano, and then from there I attempted to just name all the white Italian grapes I knew. Chardonnay-like, even. Who’d’ve thunk that this would be a Sangiovese (a red grape) without the red?! Crazy. Nerdy, even. Weird, especially because red Sangiovese typically has an undeniable aromatic savoury cherry character. Skins are important! Push down those grape skins. Pump them over. Oh, yes. It’s funny, because I always jokingly guess white Sangiovese whenever I’m blinded with a white, but this is the one time it took me forever to get it. I’ve had this wine be described to me before: memorable descriptions of red fruit have me believe that this wine is at it’s peak or over the hill (or that the taster might’ve been primed to pick up red fruit). If I was blindfolded, I’m pretty sure it would’ve been hard for me to guess the colour of the wine. In this wine, secondary characteristics reign! If this wine isn’t weird to you, it should be. Sangiovese without the red is sort of like a hot dog without the bun, a pizza without tomato sauce, or a college party without alcohol. Doable. Tricky. Atypical. Interesting? Absolutamento. Worth it?

      "description": "Haha, after having come together for a small meeting at school (UBC Wine Tasting Club  collaborated with le Club Français UBC), I did a bit of wine research and writing blog posts and what have you. You know, instead of doing homework. So, after, instead of going home from school like a good boy, I caved in on my own desires and stopped by a different branch of the private liquor store I work at. I ended up spending a ridiculous amount of time there, and left with 6 bottles even though I planned to maybe buy 1 or 2 at the most. I bought this one in particular because the workers (co-workers, technically) at the store were all curious about it. Why not take one for the team? I don’t deserve legitimate wine on a Wednesday night where I’ve done no real work. This wine is laughably bad. Seriously? If your wine ends up being a pale ruby colour, why even bother keeping “Cabernet Sauvignon” on the label? For marketing, of course, and some poor little consumer is going to buy this, thinking it’s legitimate Cab Sauv, while instead, it tastes like sugar water with a red crayon dipped in it. It has long length though, if “length” means “weird burning sensation at the back of your throat even though this is only 12.5% alcohol”. This is the kind of shit you could get hooked on if you were one of those kids who couldn’t wait until the cherry jello settled in the fridge and you couldn’t help but eat the malformed solid-liquid sugar hybrid. It’s not bad for an alcoholic drink – it’s just not proper Californian Cabernet Sauvignon. In fact, it’s legitimately the opposite of Cabernet Sauvignon, and, if you served this to me blind, I would’ve thought this was some Beaujolais Nouveau that would benefit from some chilling. In which case, I’d be glad that I bought this anyways, because the Bojo Novo was 10 bucks more (I’ve never had one…). So technically this is good. I think I’m going to chill this and pretend it’s Beaujolais Nouveau. I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a large proportion (if not all) of carbonic maceration. Use this shit for sangria. Everything Wine posts some bullshit generic Cabernet Sauvignon blurb about it which is hilariously false, but I have a weird sense of relief knowing that the people who work there haven’t actually tried it. Although it’s cheap (for a wine sold in BC, that is), there are actually decent and more concentrated wines for 10 dollars. This just isn’t one of them. The motto on the front is: “Friendship. Laughter. Skinned knees. Badminton on the lawn. BBQs on the deck. At Cul-de-Sac Wine Company, we raise a glass to good neighbours and good wines.” If you bring this shit to my damn BBQ, there will be no laughing, you will no longer be my friend, and I will trip you in your stupid hipster sailor shorts so you very well will skin your damn knees. And no badminton for your sorry ass. I will not “raise my glass to a good neighbour”: I will raise my badminton racket and beat you with it. Okay, that was harsh. The most I’ll do is give you a judging look and make fun of you. We can still play badminton on the lawn.",

I’m sure this would be their house sparkling wine if such a dumb idea from my mind existed. Also I apologize if you understood none of that – just more Game of Thrones junk (not junk) and I’m sure you’ve had your share. The nitty gritty details: the wine once retailed at around the high 20s or low 30s range, disappeared off the market for a bit, and then came back at a mere 18 bones (the agency is perhaps blowing them out? Too old, or?) so I knew I had to snag a few. I bought two, but the first bottle declined to sparkle and I subsequently wondered if I was an asshole for returning the bottle for another one. Probably. I’ve got a streak going and I gotta live up to it, anyways – I don’t want to be a good person and start all these rumours about it. Ugh. So, a similar thing happened to a friend of mine, who drank the wine anyways – because it literally is like a sparkling version of Clare Valley Riesling – floral, citrus, flecks of petrol (perhaps an artificial reference to poison? Hm?!). The palate is like sparkling lemonade sans the sugar along with wine-twists of mineral, floral character, suggestions to tropical fruit, and a soft lemon rind bitterness. It’s spring with a twist. It’s a pretty wine, and I want to gay it up and throw a flower petal into my glass (Loras Tyrell, is that you?). There’s quite a backbone of acidity but it’s well-balanced. This wine has spent 18 months on the lees, i.e. the dead yeast cells from second fermentation. Riesling isn’t a grape that typically undergoes such a process because it’s known for its opulent fruitiness, and any yeast or resulting bread flavours would only mask its natural intense persona. You get a little bit of that yeasty character from this wine, and it sort of works since this is a tighter version of Riesling where we taste restrained citrus instead of riper and sluttier fruit. And we hardly see much sparkling Riesling, anyways. I suppose the bubbles add character where I saw there could’ve been more complexity. Not negative – more clever.",

I also get some vegetal mushroom or black olive character going on, which is reminiscent of some Negroamaro or even some French Syrah that I’ve had. So far, very atypical. A dominant dried cherry note even reminds me of Sangiovese, and I can’t decide whether or not this wine would be best marketed towards wine-savvy customers who are used to a rustic style despite lack of a vintage or Protected Geographical Indication, or towards those who want a fruity-earthy bridge wine, for the same problem. That being said, this wine is a lot more earthy than I expected. The palate is light but not entirely Pinot-silky. A bit of rusticity roughens up the wine with light yet chunky tannins and a savoury back-palate. A stewed fruit character also appears. The wine does not leave the palate without a hitch, and a soft footprint of warmth is left before entirely finishing. In a blind tasting, I would definitely have guessed this as either Spanish or Italian before French. Although adding complexity, I’m wondering if that oxidized character was a lucky mistake stemming from sloppy winemaking (e.g. not careful with oxidation). That being said, this is a non-vintage blend; at best, I’d be surprised to see if this was a solera-style still red wine (yes, they exist!).

Unfortunately the information from trying the 2008 Blanc de Blancs didn’t sink in well enough, and I didn’t realize that I’ve tasted a wine from this iconic producer in the past. Although the Blanc de Noirs was definitely fruitier and fuller bodied than say, a typical Champagne, this wine was more akin to the French version of traditional method sparkling wines, being more reserved in its fruit and autolytic character. This had a bit more weight compared to the 2004 vintage Blanc de Blancs we had. All in all, this was delicious. This can easily age to evolve with more character.",

It was also my house “emergency wine”, just in case I decided I wanted to drink today (which evidently I did), and it also served as my reward wine – so I had a goal of studying a certain amount of things (Which happened to be Champagne) before I was allowed to open the wine. I didn’t end up studying as much as I wanted, but I convinced myself that cheap studying meant cheap wine. So there. New vintage. I swear I’ve seen non-vintaged versions of this same bottle, but either way, I’ve also only seen pure Macabeo versions of this wine. This vintage has the addition of Verdejo, which apparently adds to its juiciness – but I’m wondering if the subpar vintage of Europe’s 2012 had anything to do with the decision. You’d think I’d have answers after writing an entire essay about such things. There’s a whole weird smatter of fruits on the nose, but at the same time, the intensity isn’t very loud or defining. There is that subtle pomaceous fruit combined with that of stone fruits, but everything is generally mineral-driven. Same story on the palate, which is slightly more expressive. The lower tartaric acid speaks to the warmer climate of La Mancha, and all I can think of is how much I miss the sun. But the lowerish acid and simplicity does giving it a relaxing and nonchalant feel. It sort of embodies Monday afternoon, even though it’s not the pick-me-up that you might need on such a crappy day of the week. Though I secretly love Mondays. There is a bit of super subtle herbal brush on the nose, but I think that’s because I accidentally snorted a bit of dried marjoram flakes earlier in the day. Good value. It’s a good everyday bottle that’s a nice alternative to the grassier and guava-er Domaine de Grachies that I typically buy (Côtes de Gascogne), and I’ve taken notes like 3 times on that same bottle, but I’ve gotten too inebriated to type anything up about that wine before it’s too late and I forget. But it’s a Monday this time, so we’re all good. Moral of the story: drink more on Monday nights?",

After a long dry spell of wine stemming from a promised exam study session complete with delayed gratification, I decided to whip this guy off of my rack because New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is what you need when you have a white with an intense aroma profile. The nose was subdued at first but became more intense; what confused me was that it didn’t become more intense in its stereotypical NZ character. Floral and mineral were what I received off the nose, and any citrus was subdued and vague enough to not be specific. For me, at least. Intriguing, however, were the sauteed onion and honeyed spice notes I got off of a 12-dollar 2007 Chilean Sauv Blanc, except in a lighter secondary style. I don’t know what elderflower smells like so perhaps that’s what I’m getting. Texture-wise, it’s all textbook New World: rounder, slightly fuller body, lower acidity, but a flavour intensity that matched the nose: citrus and boring. I’ve had cheaper white Bordeaux that’s had more New World character than this. I’m usually a fan of atypicality, but this was slightly disappointing. Further blind tasting with my co-workers a day after confirmed my thoughts. They all thought it was an Old World wine. There was hubbub about chalkiness and even a final guess of Chablis or Chardonnay, followed by a discussion on possible malolactic fermentation. They were super surprised by the reveal, and the ones who’ve tasted this wine before or the same wine in a different vintage were sure that it tasted different. It was agreed that this had lower acidity than expected (I KNEW IT), which is weird for such a recent vintage. Bottle variation? Weird vintage? Improper storage? Did someone at the winery leave the bottle out in the sun for revenge? Was the bottle lying right next to the hottest part of the airplane? Did a hen think this was an egg? Oh, the stories!

So really, this is the first dry French Sauv-Sem blend I’ve ever had. Well, I did remember almost trying one in WSET Advanced class, but it was oxidizzled. Every other Sauv-Sem blend I’ve had was from somewhere vastly different – say Chile, or Australia. The nose was really interesting. I did get these subtle nuances of ripe fruit, which is probably where I got that candied (but not sloppy-candied, i.e. not confected) character from, with an interesting herbal note that was not unlike the green section of the produce market – fresh, but subtle and elegant. Which I can only guess was from the Sauvignon Blanc. This is a wine that’s more marketed towards the wine-savvy and the Bordeaux collectors.

We’ve had the rounds – a cold and grey morning, mist here and there, some heavier rain in the afternoon, and the weather gods have decided to reign back on the rain (pun intended), so we’re back to a slightly muggy greyness. But it’s great and I’m enjoying it, since it’s a nice refreshing change from the sun, and all I wanted to do after work on a Sunday was go home, open wine, and take my pants off. It’s one of those days. One of those “my tea’s gone cold I’m wondering why I got out of bed at all” days. Hence the choice of a hedonistic heavier Chardonnay, chosen to emulate a liquid blanket. I’m sure there’s a warm milk and malolactic fermentation joke in there somewhere. As per the bulk of Chardonnay – and aged Chardonnay, for that matter – the fruits aren’t in the forefront in a way that it’s almost difficult to pick the varieties of fruit out of the wine. The nose has an intense lees-y butteriness with layers of red apple and melon. It’s not a Californian butteriness either – it’s not a blousy sweatpants sort of style and the wine drinks like a pair of trousers with a belt for structure. There’s some mineral notes on the nose, and I’m sure I would place this in a riper area of Burgundy if it wasn’t for this weird freshness I’m getting from this wine, which I’m attributing to screwcap. There’s a mere hint of spritz which I’m hoping is natural and not from secondary fermentation (and can’t be, anyways (?), since the wine apparently has gone through 100 percent secondary malolactic fermentation). In any case, I’ve had a chat with a colleague that said that wines aged under screwcap will always have this HD freshness compared to an equivalent wine aged under cork. Along with the brightness, the wine has a drawn-out savouriness on the palate which lasts deliciously long. Fantastic middling example of developed Chardonnay – not too huge and buttery but retains finesse from both screwcap closure with developmental lees and oak tones. I’m diggin’ it.",

Hopefully the weather persists) but sometimes you feel certain feelings, like wanting to slam a hammer into some people’s skulls.

The body isn’t typically light and cheery, either. Despite remaining modest, the viscosity is supported by a present amount of fine tannin, which might be surprising to those who think Beaujolais is all gummy white wine that happens to be red.

It’s finally the day that the pre-excursion for the Wine Bloggers Conference 2015 starts – so Christine, Amy, Leeann, Sujinder and I pack up, eat breakfast at a place (i.e. delicious instant-regret-omelettes), and drive back to Elmira where some of us enjoy Gin and Tonics at the airport to revitalize our brains. Some fellow bloggers began arriving: some remember that we met last year, where I was plagued by lots of self-doubt more than the capacity to retain faces and names (ugh what a great start), and we all board the pre-excursion bus on the way to Villa Bellangelo. Hi, my name is Josh. Oh, we’ve met before? Do I, like, awkwardly take back my business card or? Swag swag swag and goodies are what we begin with, and also bumpy bus rides involving wine! We’re given glasses but also spit cups – we soon discover that none of us really has enough limbs to hold anything, so Christine and I share a waste cup with one of our four hands. At one point our bus avoids a collision and someone’s spit cup goes flying and I swear that I feel a splash on my right calf. Rock Stream 2013 Dry Cayuga White (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $13\nApparently, the Cayuga White grape is a Riesling lookalike. Hay and lemons on the nose. Relatively Riesling-like on the palate, I guess, with vague piercing citrus. Rock Stream 2013 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $15\nDusty floral perfume on the nose – almost rosemary. A burst of lemon tea on the palate with a pale finish. Rock Stream 2010 Cabernet Franc (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nThe nose reveals mostly meaty tomato leaf, menthol, and a bit of cherry. Velvety cooked raspberries on the palate with zippy black cherry and fine light tannin. Seneca Shore Pinot Grigio (Finger Lakes, New York) $15\nA bit of SO2 on the nose? Crisp and fresh lemon seed on the palate, maybe a hint of grapefruit? Correct if not slightly dull but maybe needs to open up. Seneca Shore Riesling Semi-Dry (Finger Lakes, New York) $13\nMuted. A bit stony – herbaceous maybe? Quite zippy and electric and much drier than I expected. Seneca Shore Queen Charlene’s Dry Rosé (Finger Lakes, New York) $12\n100% Pinot Noir, and named after the winemaker’s wife or something kind of cute. Almost like a still version of a particular Crémant rosé, with a lightly floral nose, red fruit, and ripe pear. Easily the best of the Seneca Shore wines we tasted by far. We’re warmly greeted at the beautiful Villa Bellangelo, where a glass of rosé and an opening speech by Chris Missick (owner) is followed by four stations: an area with bits and bites, a station with a flight of Riesling, a station with something like a 10-year vertical of Cabernet Sauvignon (immediate gasp from the group of bloggers) from King’s Garden Vineyards, and a sort of in-between miscellaneous Villa Bellangelo table. My current emotion: enjoying life with shorts that need ironing. Also, that’s a tube of lip balm. I’m stubborn so I come with the mission to try and taste everything. Everyone obviously goes to the table with the Cab vertical and I rush right over to the Riesling table because in this moment I am a Riesling cheerleader sporting a sleeveless shirt instead of a short skirt. I’m absorbed and focussed to the point where a fellow blogger approaches the table, places her hand on my shoulder, and jokingly tells me I don’t need to hog the space. In my mind I was having a Real Housewines of New York confessional monologue about how I couldn’t believe I was dealing with this instead of taking a picture of myself outside on the patio milking a goat, but I knew she was mostly jesting and okay fine maybe I was hogging the table shh. I made it partway through the miscellaneous table before we were told our time was up. Ugh – this is interrupted elementary school recess all over again. Also, click here to see local coverage on this particular event including a partially flattering one-second clip of me jotting something down. Yes. Bellangelo 2013 Rosé (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $13\n30% Pinot Noir, 30% Cabernet Franc, 40% Chardonnay. Flowers, watermelon, and pear, maybe a hint of raspberry bubble gum. Dry, light, pretty. Rieslings, poured by Dan Bissell (assistant winemaker) and Nathan Kendall (head winemaker): Bellangelo 2012 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York) $19\nAND SO IT BEGINS. Lime and liquid stones. Glacial and icy, sort of like Meryl Streep in the Devil Wears Prada? Bellangelo 2013 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $18\n7% aged in neutral French oak for 3 months. A little more honeyed and friendly, but still mostly edgy lime. So like Meryl Streep towards the end of said movie. Bellangelo 2014 Dry Riesling (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nDefinitely has the most fruit intensity of the Dry Rieslings, with some grass and grapefruit reminiscent of Sauvignon Blanc. Some Granny Smith apple here and there. Unreleased? Bellangelo 2012 “1866 Reserve” Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York) $32\nWe glide into petrol territory here, with an off-dryness accented by peach and lemon. Elegant and gossamer but taut and concentrated. Bellangelo 2012 Riesling Semi Dry (Finger Lakes New York) $?\nA hint of something slightly skunky or herbaceous though I’m still sort of into it. There’s a pinch of well-balanced sweetness with some stone fruit. Bellangelo 2011 Riesling Semi Dry (Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nA bit muted fruit on the nose with something smoky, and then there’s an intriguing meatiness on the palate that replaces the colourfulness in previous examples. Bellangelo 2014 Riesling [dropped “semi-dry” designation] (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $?\nLeafy, stony, with lots of grapefruit and even a hint of durian. Off-dry but quite bright. Bellangelo 2013 Riesling Semi Dry (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $18\n17% aged in neutral French oak for three months. Quiet stone fruit, something pollen-like, and muted honey. Medium-dry and textured; definitely the most slutty of the lot. Lots of lime and margarita and things. Is “semi-dry” starting to sound like a really good baby name or no? Bellangelo 2012 “Gibson Vineyard” Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York) $22\nA bit shy on the nose, but then an explosion of honeyed white peach on the palate. Interested to see what this could do with age. I might lazily re-use a terrible “Riesling to the occasion” joke. And, the others, poured by Becky (friendly knowledgable awesome human): Bellangelo 2013 Dry Chardonnay (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nLarge proportion was oaked for 8 months with full malolactic fermentation. Reminds me of that Connecticut Chardonnay I had just a couple of days ago: steely but buttery with oak. Personally, I could use more fruit intensity to balance the scale. Bellangelo 2013 Unoaked Chardonnay (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $15\n30% Chardonnay Musqué. Skunky? Maybe a hint of cork taint? I doubt myself so I made some other friends smell this and we agreed that the particular bottle was maybe off but we couldn’t agree on why. Need to retry. Bellangelo 2013 “1866 Reserve” Gewurztraminer (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $32\nClassy and a bit more more hushed for Gew. One sniff and I’m pretty sure I was transported to someone’s grandma’s quaint bathroom that smells dainty and floral and definitely has a pastel colour palate along with a fuzzy pink toilet cover. Aged in neutral French oak for 10 months. Bellangelo 2012 Gewurztraminer (Finger Lakes, New York) $20\nStill elegant but spicier rather than flowery. Off-dry but barely, and with stony restraint. I vibe with this wine. Bellangelo 2013 Seyval Blanc (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $16\nLovely and graceful with something buttery but not quite? Greek yoghurt perhaps? Odd because this has been aged in 100% stainless steel with no malolactic. Off-dry and intense lemon sorbet on the palate. I’m impressed with a Seyval Blanc and I feel weird about it. Bellangelo “Bella Fresca” $?\nChardonnay, Gewurztraminer, Seyval Blanc, Cayuga White, and Muscat – I think? Didn’t get to spend much time with this and I don’t trust my tasting note but this perhaps had a bit of a weird and slightly herbaceous character. Also need to retry.",

      "description": "Yay! So a miniature celebration was in order after having completed the WSET Diploma Unit 4 (Spirits) and half of Unit 1 (Business) exams and essays. Slaved over cue cards and confusing non-wine tastings plus sleepless nights over essays (from which I’m still unfortunately recovering), and this wine serves both an homage to the past and future – I thought it would be cool to retry a wine I had a little more than a year ago in my WSET Level 3 class, and maybe refresh my actual wine tasting ability I’ll need for January. My tasting notes will probably be a little more tight and specific compared to a year and a half ago, and I’m slightly scared to see how different my tasting notes will be. I’m glad there’s no time limit or fear of reading out this time around. The wine is as close to itself as I can remember. Compared to other Cava I’ve tried, there is a less fruity and more elegant lightness to it. Fruits are a bit hard to determine on the nose, but there is a marked yeastiness – perhaps not as marked as I remember. There is a hint of butter stemming from what I’m guessing is either MLF or the addition of Chardonnay. The only qualm I have with the wine is its structure – thankfully enough that was the same issue that was brought up when we tasted it in class a year ago. Ironically I sometimes enjoy a sparkling with a lower acidity since the bubbles already add a refreshing character, but the slight lack in structure gives it a bit of a knockdown in terms of objective quality. It’s a bit of a tradeoff, because it’s a bit more complex than some other Cava in the price range. It’s a mellow but slightly more complex basic sparkler – it’s that one quiet person at that house party who doesn’t get as drunk as everyone else does and you end up having an intelligent conversation with them but you can’t really tell because you’re, well, drunk.",

It’s a polarizing grape at which wine drinkers subconsciously learn to either smile or shudder from the mention of its name (may the odds be ever in your favour), and the subsequent hilarious discord that it produces in the wine world makes me love it even more. The grape produces wines which aren’t strangers to levels of volatile acidity, which expresses itself with a pungency, sometimes in a vinegary or nail polish-y sort of way. The contradictory grape is great because it can express a cornucopia of non-fruity aromas but isn’t elegant about it like top-notch Savennières or aged Bordeaux, and instead it Harlem Shakes its way into your nasal cavity without giving a shit about what you think. Pinotage breaks rules. I’m not going to lie – I bought and opened the wine with the intention of likening it to Katniss Everdeen (the heroin to the Hunger Games trilogy, if you weren’t in the loop of LIFE) and it really does make sense. The ashy earthiness is reminiscent of the coal mines of District 12 and the arena of the annual deathly sport. Pinotage usually has a demurely vibrant character that mirrors the silent and present strength of Katniss, and this particular Pinotage has a heavy-handedness that doesn’t completely translate into being full-bodied and instead has a slight agile lightness and roundness. The tannins hide a bit of character in the mouth, and despite the expected full-bodied character, there almost seems to be a bit of a hollow midpalate. Though the wine has a bit of a typical medicinal character (that I will shamelessly and obviously compare to first-aid kits that the Hunger Games contestants might use), the wine has more of a deep fruitiness and less of an overt meaty character and loud ripe pungent sweet spice that I’ve seen in other examples of Pinotage – perhaps this is due to young age? This wine sort of opens up with that sort of character. I’m inexperienced with Pinotage. But the high and balanced alcohol is definitely fitting for The Girl On Fire. I’m currently reading the first book after seeing the first two movies in the series. The 15% ABV of this wine is telling me I should eat something or drink water, but I almost feel guilty doing that while reading the book. How Hunger Games-y",

It’s a bit of an in-between sparkler (that is, between the retention of fruitiness that is a typical tank method sparkling wine; and the generally more autolytic and finely moussed traditionally-made sparkling wine), but that’s exactly what the transfer method results in, flavour-wise, really. That being said, this was pretty good value. There were hints of autolytic character – namely the yeasty and bread dough-like components – which melded together with the subtle aromas of ripe apple, peach, and melon. There was also a bit of buttery malolactic character which arose due to the early picking of the grapes, which retains fruity aromas but also retains a larger proportion of malic acid. The malic acid is then converted to lactic acid. Yay, science! (What if there was a Magic School Bus episode on wine, except everyone was an adult? Can someone make this?! #WSET) The wine was the same on the palate. Generally medium components with echoing flavour characteristics. The wine is ripe, bright, round, positive, and optimistic. It’s certainly not a wow-factor wine, but it’s certainly fantastic for what you get at $14. It’s sort of like Thursday afternoon, where the anticipation of Friday itself is exciting – but it’s still not Friday. It’s kind of like HEY LET’S CELEBRATE! (but not too much!)",

Most of her songs scream Prosecco, Moscato, or fresh and fruity, but then there’s this little guy, who isn’t without a touch of sweetness anyways. The wine is interesting and hits notes somewhere in-between two wide styles: Fino sherry, embodying the fresh exciting savoury newness that induces hunger, and Oloroso sherry, which is the nutty and more oxidized blanket of sugarless caramel. This wine has some of that exciting Fino freshness, but it’s framed by an aged and nostalgic frame of grilled nuttiness. The parts of freshness and reminiscence both come together to make this interesting narrative of cool disjointedness, hence “The One That Got Away”. (That is, if you imagine that Katy Perry was mostly singing about protective yeast cells and Fino sherry.) This wine is a Palo Cortado-style wine, but has since lost the ability to carry the designation from the bit of sugar that it carries (from backsweetening). These wines start off as the flor-blanketed Fino (or destined to be an aged Amontillado), only to have the flor die in the process and have the partially-briny sherry become more oxidative and dark in character. The yeast that got away. I guess that’s an even better thing depending on the circumstance. The wine was delicious, and even more so when we compared the rest of the wines in the flight back to this one. Concentrated aromas of grilled salted almonds, toffee, and – I swear by it – a hint of peanut butter.

Trendy, meaning that the regular consumer is becoming more interested; agencies are marketing grower Champagne more than before; and my parents are suddenly in love with quinoa. It’s not a terribly well-known fact that a large proportion of Champagne houses buy grapes from vineyards and produce wine, while the more elusive grower Champagne is made from grapes from which the grower themselves grew. This latter style of Champagne alludes to a more representative wine of the vineyards (but this doesn’t necessarily mean quality). This wine was a fantastic grower Champagne that was chosen in our flight to contrast with a much more mass-produced bottle. This was much more autolysis-driven, with aromas that combined to form a sort of buttered pastry sort of smell. Breakfast in a glass? Good morning. This wine was much rounder than the first, being slightly heavier in body and alcohol, along with a slightly lower acidity. The subtle ripeness of this wine led some of the class to meander a guess of a traditionally-made New World version, myself included – but it just so happens that this was a Champagne where the acidity didn’t create a river of saliva in your mouth. Toasty, biscuity, and almost buttery tones led me to think this was a Chardonnay-dominated blend, but this could’ve been a fluke. (Full moon tonight. Does my nose turn freakishly werewolfy once a month?!) Where the Möet & Chandon Champagne is kind of like Starbucks, this bottle represents the less-popular coffee shop down the road which is slightly more expensive but just happens to be more delicious.

And the pinkness makes it more interesting. And yes – I do admit that the differences between this and the Crémant were almost indistinguishable unless you *really* stuck your nose in there and got a real sense of the characters of the wines – but perhaps the non-vintageness of the wine was at fault. I *do* admit that this wine wins in terms of the complexity. The yeastiness is barely above a notch in intensity, but the riper fruit matches the liveliness and effervescence of a rosé Champagne. I also did note the higher intensity on the palate, which was nicer. The bubbles were more aggressive, but the temperature of the bottles may have been wonky.

As soon as I took a sniff, it was perhaps a mistake to write “muscat? gew?” on my tasting notes before I was done with the entire grid. But it is tough – the pronounced stone fruit, tropical fruit, and spice flavours often allude to a small set of grapes with similar profiles – even the bit of Froot Loops-y cardamom I got on the nose was reminiscent of Viognier, but it turned out to be Muscat. It was the next wine that was Gewurztraminer, which in turn, I had guessed was Muscat. Apparently this is a unique style of Muscat, since drier, more full styles are less common – so a guess of Gew was “more likely” – although the deeper colour of the next wine should’ve hinted to Gew. Muscat is another grape with a reputation for sweeter wines, and, compared to the Riesling example, it’s much more justified this time because it really is hard to find drier versions – but they exist. It already seems one note, but interestingly enough, there are sub-varieties of Muscat, all with slightly different profiles. I believe this was made of the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains variety, which is considered the finest sub-variety of Muscat, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if this was Muscat Ottonel, which is a lower acid, more pungent style of the grape, which finds itself at one of its homes in Alsace. The wine itself was delicious. Lower-acid, overt stone and tropical fruits, but not totally veering into the perfumed floral character that some other grapes do. Not syrupy either, but there is some sort of structure, if barely. The complexity is definitely there. An interesting try for 30 dollars.",

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 5: Alsace] Indisputably Gewurztraminer on the nose (if not Muscat), where it was like liquid Bed Bath and Beyond. I might as well have taken a big whiff of my grandma’s purse, and it probably would have been more accurate had she been the source of my late aunt’s durian-eating habits. I mean I guess the wine isn’t so much durian-driven than it is lychee and peaches, but still. I noticed a bit of bubble by just looking at the glass, as did some other classmates, and indeed there was just a hint of spritz on the palate that other people detected. What’s interesting is that we had the exact same wine no more than a couple months prior, and then it seemed perfectly fine, but an in-bottle malolactic fermentation was a possibility for the bit of spritz for this time around. Interestingly enough I noted a fuller body this time around when I compared my notes, which would be a point in favour of the malolactic fermentation hypothesis. Who knows. Regardless, the palate had similar flavours and was a bit more soapy and floral than I remembered, with low acid and a full body allowing full force. Some classmates thought it was a bit flat but malolactic fermentation would have made hushed the primary fruit and made the low acid even lower. It kinda makes sense.",

All due to the fact that our exam was right after our sparklings, anyways.  I’m slightly disappointed I didn’t write more about this wine! In theory it’s interesting:\n1) Having the “Vouvray” sub-region designation, we know that it’s 100% Chenin Blanc, which is my favourite white grape (for now, anyways).\n2) The “Crémant” designation means that its made from the traditional method, so we can expect some of that yeasty autolytic character.\n3) Cute and laid-back label. Very much a big contrast to the big LETS-PARTY-AND-GET-DRUNK labels you might see. Of course you don’t judge a book by a cover, but you can’t skim through a bottle of wine. It’s a commitment. Presentation is key! I noted that it was quite Old World in character, with restrained, steely fruit, and plenty of mineral character. Quite a delicate version of a (sparkling) Vouvray. What does that even say? Peril Shrugs? (Band name anyone?)

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 6: Rhône] We had just three wines in our first flight (this was the third), and all were from the northern Rhône, we were told. The first was obviously a Viognier, but the second and the third were clearly born of the same idea, if not grape. Though the wine was clearly more youthful from just the looks of it, it also smelled more playful than its previous, with more intense aromas of flowers and riper fruit to replace the smoked meat. Hermitage is the rare and more famous appellation and hill, of course, and even by looking at a map and seeing how Crozes-Hermitage surrounds Hermitage like a donut, we can predict off the bat that slopes here aren’t as dramatic. Quality is less consistent for an area that produces around eight times as much wine as its famous hill, and even differing soil types vary from the north to the south. Granitic slopes in the north, more alluvial in the south. Shit, I need to start committing these soil types to memory. I’ll picture a Tim Hortons donut that’s only been half-glazed, or something. The wine was delicious. Not as stereotypically *~Syrah~* as the previous, but still pretty damn good, and apparently showing very typical for the appellation.",

Advertisements for this wine are plastered throughout the city, and this is one of the wines that I undoubtedly remember that customers always ask for even though (and probably because) it’s heavily listed and well-known. For good reason, too – this wine screams typicality at a good price, with grassy and vegetal aromas that are intensely displayed on the nose. Could be more complex, though. Palate-wise, this is great. High acidity makes it zippy, patio-worthy, and food-friendly. Cue stupid summer Old Navy commercial here. I find New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc weirdly deceiving because these wines seem as though they should fit a specific mould and intensely grassy profile, but differences between this wine, the 2011 Ata Rangi Sauvignon Blanc, and the 2010 Greywacke Sauvignon Blanc are quite evident. I think I’m in a Sauv Blanc phase. I had a taste of a delicious Chilean Sauvignon Blanc just the other day and I’m re-hooked. I guess that means Spring is coming.",

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 8: Burgundy] There’s something really funky and weird about this wine, in an awesome way (though what isn’t funky and weird in Racine’s portfolio?). It’s strange for it to be introduced in class as our benchmark example of Beaujolais, with this eccentric combination of raspberry lambic beer, garden soil, a mouthful of red fruit, and a hint of spice and dirty socks. Not typical or traditional, in my opinion, but really cool, and I most certainly hope that something funky and sort of new age, for Beaujolais, strikes the fancy of more consumers. A pipe dream, perhaps, because I’ve heard this described as a wine that would get hipsters in New York hot and heavy. I’m not sure if that’s a positive thing but I’m into it. This style of Beaujolais is obviously deeper in colour and more concentrated than its younger brothers and sisters at the Villages level and lower.

The refreshing rosé I decided to open was unfortunately off, so for some reason I turned to the wine rack and picked the biggest red of the drink-now sort of variety – and after writing that tasting note I immediately regret it. It’s a fantastic wine – but somehow its weight and its mouth-coating quality add to the temperature in this room, which has a small oddly-placed window that hardly lets out any heat. After any sort of hot shower on a hot day followed by a dry-off in my room always ends up like some form of locker room steam situation. Or something. The wine is reminiscent of something or someone big and bold, yet is shadowed and shows restraint in character with leather reins made of tannin along with secondary coffee and spice characteristics. But it’s a mouthful. If you want a non-alcoholic approximation, drink coffee dusted with chocolate powder – then have a leather daddy stuff berries into your mouth with his Doc Martens. It’s a forceful wine that’s reminiscent of the fruit-forward (ha) jam-bombs of California (whatup, Zin?), but there remains this secondary spicy character full of cinnamon, coffee, and some vanilla – a great transition wine for anyone stuck in the new world trough of jammy Californian wines. It’s also notable how a mere 4 months of oak can impart that much instant and hedonistic complexity. Perhaps it’s more like the Hulk or Bruce Banner – brooding and studious tones of dark fruit and coffee on the nose, but exploding with strength on the palate. There’s admittedly a little less leather than I’d like (in the wine), but apparently it’s more prominent with age (in the wine). The wine has its shortfalls when it comes to its alcohol content – it comes off as a little hot, but I’m not sure leather daddies – or the Hulk, for that matter – are supposed to be elegant, anyways. The alcohol and ripe fruit give a slight impression of sweetness. I’m not sure it’s what I want on a muggy Vancouver night but I’ll take it. (The wine.)",

I took the advice of a classmate (also an ISG graduate) that I met during the Intro Court of Master Sommeliers course – apparently, the BCL has one Viognier from India that is fantastic value and is very varietally expressive – one which she tried during one of her ISG classes. Coupled with the fact that I’ve been craving heavy yet bright and fresh wines with sort of the Alsatian Riesling or German Weissburgunder sort of feel – I decided to go for it. And I know – Viognier isn’t any sort of bright and acidic grape, but I’m all for new and crazy shit. (Because while life is too short to not try an Indian Viognier, it’s also too long to try the Zind Humbrecht Pinot Blanc, which is actually mostly Auxerrois (damn it, Alsace!)). The wine shouts Viognier – sweet floral notes along with stone fruit and tropical fruit flavours yell typical for the grape variety, with a heady spiciness not veering too far from the likes of Alsatian Gewürztraminer or Muscat. And despite the voluptuous body and warming alcohol, the wine isn’t as flamboyant on the palate – the intensity shows a bit of restraint. The acidity isn’t fresh, but it’s there, and it’s enough to keep things balanced. Makes sense though – it’s Viognier. And of course, the typical slightly imbalanced phenolic bitterness that Viognier can have – common and hard to pull off. All in all, think Californian (or Australian) Viognier with a little more elegance. There is a lightness to the wine despite the viscosity – the balance isn’t perfect, but it’s good enough. I must be missing something – vineyards close to the water for moderated temperatures, high altitudes, or short-lived vines – because India has a strikingly hotter climate compared to the other winemaking regions on the planet, which can equate to vines that tire themselves out without the winter to build up carbohydrate reserves. Or, an interesting amount of alcoholic photoshop to the wine. Who knows. I’m interested, but I can’t find a spec sheet, or I’m too lazy to really try. Because it’s 1AM on a Saturday night and all I want to do is drink wine and be as flabby as Viognier can be. I’m sort of impressed. And satiated.

I decided that the former option was better, so I arrived shortly after the nearby polling station was open. Though I spotted a roll of “I voted!” stickers, I was for some reason not offered one, and then I remembered that it was 8AM on a Saturday morning and I probably looked like a troll who was able to make high heel shoe-esque sounds with ratty sneakers that boomed throughout the solemn elementary school gym. I was given shifty looks, as if the workers were definitely sure I was going to write “penis” 300 times all over the ballot. I didn’t, by the way. Is anybody else sitting at home with a glass of wine on a Saturday night just refreshing results pages or nah #cityvotes2014 #vanpoli — Joshua Decolongon (@joshlikeswine) November 16, 2014  I haven’t had wine in the past few days. So I’m going to drink this and pretend that it’s representative of the election or something. I’m currently refreshing a results page and watching this one particular Twitter page like a hawk. Is this what listening to hockey on the radio feels like? The wine is distinctly floral and full of savoury minerality, like a cross between a young Loire Chenin Blanc and an old world Viognier. The slightly weighty palate has exuberant peaches and slices of citrus that are blanketed by stones and flowers, evolving into a walnut pastry sort of finish. Lees ageing adds just a bit of girth and makes the palate glow with some fleshiness, which was much more evident and enjoyable closer to room temperature, where I found the savouriness toned down to balance with the fruit. Here’s the spec sheet, and here’s the chef’s pairing suggestion. Jesus – you know I can’t resist a deliciously blurry maccheroncini. Verdicchio isn’t a grape you hear of regularly, and it often gets lost in the barrage of the underdog multisyllables of Italy, like Vermentino, Catarratto, Falanghina, Grechetto, and Erbaluce. Verdicchio’s home is in the Marche region of Italy, where two DOCs reign supreme: the saintly-sounding Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi, and the satanic-sounding (“but it’s not, mom, I swear”) Verdicchio di Matelica. La Monacesca is highlighted in Jancis Robinson’s Wine Grapes as a producer for the appellation (and more specifically for the Mirum label), and it’s something I have yet to try, along with the DOCG Riserva versions of the stated appellations. It’s hardly what everyone votes for, I suppose. Verdicchio for mayor!",

I bounced around between several bottles before settling on this dude. And then I realized how poor I am. Yay! The cork was horrifying. Upon lifting the foil at the top, we discovered that the cork almost had something like a mini-pool of wine at the top and was damp all throughout. With some effort we removed the cork properly without a hitch, and the golden liquid was free for us to taste. As expected, the nose is interesting and complex. Any fruit exists only as a ghost of citrus dominated by secondary and tertiary characteristics. Honey, wax, and butterscotch are all evident. There are also some weird aromas – weird in the sense that the aromas might be bizarre or even repulsive to the newcomer (like petrol notes in aged Riesling) but interesting to the wine nerd nonetheless. And by that, I mean we smelled cabbage and garbage water, but like, in a good way. There was also a flutter of a wet asphalt minerality – almost like fresh rain on a road. Ironic aromas reminiscent of fresh images, considering the age on this. Less graceful on the palate – the acidity was impressive, but almost unwoven, as per with the alcohol which seemed to slightly warm the back despite lower alcohol. Definitely powerful, concentrated, and round, with a bright citrus character dominating the palate. Slight sherry-like oxidative quality on the finish. Long length. What’s interesting is that they apparently experimented with this wine by ageing it in French oak for 18 months. This is definitely a nerd wine – I can see the regular consumer being interested in trying this, but be easily repulsed at the same time. This wine is also quite concentrated and powerful – not for the faint-hearted. If I had this by itself, I’d only be able to have one glass. Perhaps this calls for food, and my colleagues and I agreed that some sort of fatty smoked fish would work. Could this age? The developed characteristics tell me that even if it could, changes would be minute, and could very well veer into the depths of full oxidation. Though, the acidity and structure is definitely there, and Chateau Musar is known for creating long-lived wines, so it very well might be possible. My experience with Lebanese wines is extremely limited. Well, near non-existent, really. We’re not entirely sure but we’re pretty certain that the wine became darker only after a couple hours after opening it.",

I really don’t mind the disjointed 1-day weekends because I go crazy after not having human contact after 2-day weekends (especially now that most friends are in exam mode), especially with the whole saving-money-and-don’t-go-out sort of thing. So my unexpected 2-day weekend was met with a half-finished blog post, nothing, Project runway, more nothing, and a decision to open this Malbec. Because I was strong enough to not drink anything yesterday (up until that pisco + orange juice experiment) and because I feel like I haven’t truly relaxed for the past couple of days. Which is dangerous when that thought changes once you open a bottle of $40 wine in solitude. At first I was not impressed with the wine. Initial upfront fresh earthiness upon opening a wine always gives me paranoid thoughts of it being corked, but I let the wine open up and it delivered. On the nose, the Malbec is dominated with s spectrum of punchy fruit along with an earthiness and slight smokiness – the wine has been aged for 12 months in French oak so this is unsurprising. The peppery oakiness wraps around a prominent dark cherry, dark fruit, and slightly dried floral and raspberry character, opening up to hints of leather and dark chocolate. The deep fruit resides well with the earthy components, both being quite present. The palate is much more expressive than the nose, with vibrant and ripe fruit characteristics that echo the fruits on the palate. What’s interesting to me is that we expect a mouthful of viscous syrup with the whopping 14.5% (!!!) alcohol, but the wine retains some level of finesse without loss to concentration. Structure is on the medium side, which unwinds the knots on the deep fruit flavours and silky texture. Which is exactly what you want on a night when all you’re doing is wearing the same thing you were wearing 48 hours ago while having back to back Project Runway marathons. Because you can. The ripe fruit contrasts with the slight extracted-tasting bitter finish. Although this might seem like a championing excuse, I feel like this prevents the wine from being too cloying. The alcohol is well-balanced. I had to warm up to this Malbec. I was literally craving an overextracted viscous wine, but this demonstrated the difficult balance between ripe, warm-climate reds without over-sleazing the wine. I was undecided between “good” and “very good”, but I eventually landed on the former category, though on the higher side. Tall, dark, handsome, suave, flirty, foreign.

The wine is interesting. There is partial carbonic maceration, so you do get some bright cheery fruit, but the 100 percent ambient yeasts gives an interesting personality to the wine. There is a funky and slight medicinal character that you get and might expect from foreign yeast, but the character as a whole is very much vibrantly juicy, grapey, and happy – so it does retain that big fruity Bojo character, but there’s much more complexity. Interestingly enough, the wine is also unfined and unfiltered.

Add a Sélection de Grains Nobles wine to the list of wines that are so rare, such that getting to taste one is simultaneously enough and not enough. Fuck. It was reminiscent to the first wine in our flight of three, in that there was a real evolved pomaceous fruit character, with bruised red apple and dried pear that met with dried peaches, some apricots, honey, spice, mushroom, and apple jam. This might sound identical to so many other kinds of aged sweet wine, say an aged sweet Chenin from the Loire Valley, but there’s a huge emphasis on the bruised apple flavour, and interestingly enough, a lack of that oxidative nutty character you might find. A darker colour, too. Perhaps it’s because this wine still remains really fresh, especially on the palate, where acid is high but well-hidden like a stoner on Commercial Drive, and you can almost pick out the interaction between the brightness and the succulent apple fruit on the palate. It’s almost like there’s a hint of juicy brine character that keeps the flavours twinkling on the palate, like salted caramel ice cream or pride glitter you just can’t get off yourself for some reason. Spoiler alert: it’s not cheap. But there’s a holiday dinner party I have to help throw in a couple of weeks and I might just have to buy this and hope that it’s a hit.

I’m a big fan of (quality) sweeter Vouvray, where luscious sweet honeyed quince notes are balanced by high acidity. It’s another one of those wines you want to open for people who swear that sweet wines are the equivalent to Satan, or something. Vouvray, if I’m correct, is the appellation in the Loire which plants the most Chenin Blanc, and the region produces the wine in all styles depending on the vintage – so sparkling, still, and sweet versions are all made. An easy goto for the “if you could drink only one wine for the rest of your life what would it be?” question. Huet is one of the superlative producers of Vouvray – I’ve had one or two Huet wines in the past and I’ve enjoyed them. Had this not been a horrible vintage, the quality would be higher. Unfortunately, the nose and palate were muted and marred by a bit of bitterness, perhaps from some rot. The class agreed, and most placed this in the good category while some thought this was full-on very good quality. That being said, structurally it was fantastic, and the medium-dry wine was balanced out beautifully by high acid. I just wish there could’ve been more fruit and intensity – I wonder whether or not this would develop positively after a couple of years.",

We then flipped to this Australian sparkling, which I think is made in the transfer method. Much like the Franciacorta, this was a bit of a departure from the green apple-y fruits of Champagne and more into the citrus and stone fruit sort of spectrum, with hints of herbaceousness, toastiness, and yeastiness. Tastes like happy and yum! I can understand how this might be seen as a bit simple but it seems crafted well. Pair this with a happy-go-lucky bubbly Green Day song. I’m generally unfamiliar with this style of wine, so I guessed something that might be dominated by Pinot Noir due to the slightly more fruit-forward visage (Blanc de Noirs?) but there wasn’t enough austerity, general yeastiness, or green fruit that lead me down that path. It was bright enough to have me guessing a Crémant, but I axed my second guess and went with a New World sparkling. From where? Not even sure.

As a relatively soft and medium-bodied grape with higher acidity, it takes the spot of almost a sub-noble position – fresh like young Pinot, bodied and nosed like Merlot, finished with a strong dash of Italian:  sometimes some sour cherry notes and soft yet often astringent tannins. And yet, the grape still has a spectrum, even if a small one – the softer and friendlier Asti versions, to the darker, serious ones of the Alba – both areas in Piedmont. The only Barbera from Asti I’ve ever had has set the standard for all Barbera since then, and the dried, sweeter red fruit I expect is usually replaced by darker, smokier, and sometimes clunkier fruit that I always assume is more Alba-like in character. Hence the guess. This wine did have that “darkness” – black and sour cherries, spice, but a slight green herbal note which may have stemmed from a cooler, less ripe year for Piedmont. There was nothing overtly wrong with the wine – it was just simple and fresh. There was an interesting smoky darkness on the nose that someone thought may have stemmed from rot, but who knows? It’s not a grape that’s well-known, but apparently has potential to flourish around the world due to its easy-going nature both in the vineyard and in people’s mouths.",

Producers like Nichol and Kettle Valley come to mind right away: I wonder if the winemakers have been inspired by such a small region with an esoteric style – if that were the case, then that’s pretty awesome, knowing that this kind of rosé isn’t an overdone style that’s executed to make money. It’s a nod and a twist and a sashay. I’m glad we tried a wine from Reuilly, because it’s one of those tiny appellations often eclipsed by the big boys in its respective area, like Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. The region does make its fair share of gentle Sancerre-esque whites, but the region is also known for its rosés made from Pinot Noir and more so Pinot Gris, along with some light reds made from Pinot Noir. The wine was good to very good quality. Flavours were mostly in the green fruit and stone fruit range, most notably baked pear and white peach. There was a fantastic balance of minerality as well, with floral notes and a savoury texture also joining the mix.

This second wine was the complete opposite, with super-restrained flavours hiding behind a shield of acid and maybe just a hint of texture. Everyone and I thought this was a Muscadet, which is a Loire wine made from the super-neutral Melon de Bourgogne grape. The grape is moulded into a textured and yeasty wine by processes involving storing the wine over fine lees (dead yeast cells), so all of it made sense, and almost everyone thought this was one of acceptable to good quality – lifeless but satisfactory. So it turns out this was a 63-dollar wine from a well-reputed producer. This shocked everyone in the class, and my request to revisit the wine for a second pour was mirrored by everyone else. It was just so neutral – a dumb phase, perhaps, requiring a bit of age to open up, plus, possibly, a relatively tougher vintage which shrouded the wine from being its usual self. There was some texture and a longer finish that bumped up the quality, according to instructor, and maybe the acid was unbalanced in this case, which, like the vintage, veiled the wine from its true elements. A bit of a mineral funkiness found itself on both the nose and the palate, but the whole flavour profile was so quiet to begin with that you’re not sure whether or not you’re picking these things out of nowhere. Apparently this is a Loire Sauvignon Blanc that’s supposed to emphasize terroir unlike the previous wine in the flight which was punchier and more “obviously Sauvignon Blanc” in style. We were posed a question: would we have placed this in the same quality camp if we were told this was from Burgundy? Fair point. I guess if you were to look at it from a high-quality standpoint, it most certainly resembles the steely Chablis of northern Burgundy.",

(A bit of a paint-thinner spirit-y thing on the nose which I get from many Muscat vins doux naturels, which I’d like to think only adds to my comparison.) The wine is a solid good quality – there’s doubtless concentration and intensity in this fortified Muscat wine, but it’s a bit syrupy and one-note. But that’s the thing: everyone in the class seemed to mercilessly bully the wine in a way that some people poke at Michael Cera with a long and awkward stick for being the same person in all of the films he’s in. But the instructor reminded us that we can’t always damn Muscat for making slightly lower acid and cloying wines, because that’s sometimes just the way it is, and that’s just how it typically exists as a grape. That being said, Muscat de Beaumes de Venise – which is essentially partially fermented Muscat whose journey in conversion from sugar to alcohol has been interrupted by grape spirit and is therefore sweet – is similar to Prosecco in the sense that you’re mostly going to run into styles that belong to the “good quality” designation.

I sheepishly display my confusion and partial sophomoric knowledge on German wines here, in part because a lot of the German wines I come across are too expensive for me. I’ve also noticed that Riesling has been in a bit of a negative light to the regular consumer, and it’s all about the dry. Riesling is as out as much as Coco Rocha is in, and despite its food pairing versatility, people avoid it like the plague because they think it’ll be like juice. The university crowd likes this – I introduced Riesling to a group of university students and they went forth and spread their knowledge to their fellow brobots. Back on topic – the vintage. Among other 2011 German Riesling vintages (most notably the 2011 Selbach Riesling and the 2011 Rudolf Muller Riesling), I’ve noticed that these wines lack the aromaticity that I expect from Riesling. Perhaps I don’t drink enough Old World Riesling to truly understand the character in its European homeland. Here, we have a wine with a strength that lies in its elegance. Delicate aromas are vague at first, but reveal themselves as sweet (but not canned) yet restrained fruity characteristics with a flowery nose. A restrained minerality blankets the whole. But I’m really just trying to be poetic, here. It smells like high class fruity sugar water with some pebbles mixed in. The palate is light and has a brush of medium sweetness that jumps away by a rather unexpected modest amount of acidity and a solid amount of minerality that shines at the back of the tongue. The acidity is not as high as I expected but is present enough to barely negate the cloy. The length is average, and the little bit of tangy citrus spritz is reminiscent of an applause that doesn’t seem to reach its plateau. Elegant and unassuming, but I almost feel like there’s something missing, besides a slight lack in acidity. Ageing might be an interesting thing to play around with this wine because I feel like there are characteristics that need developing.

I’ve seen this bottle for a while and its look has changed from a faux-classic cream-coloured label (with an indication of Malvasia Muscat, now to Malvasia Moscato. Hmm?) to something a little more plain and bold in a weird way. There’s something about the bottles that tell me what they’re like on the front side – that turn me off, but it’s not a bad marketing technique for the lower-priced bottles. Also, they misspelled “floral” and it says “florat”. Mmm, Florat tones! I’ve never had a Malvasia outside of Madeira. From what I know, it’s low in acidity and has floral and stone fruit aromas in its still form, so it understandably blends well with Moscato. This wine gains points for typicity: I smell canned stone fruits with a bit of a tropical kick and some flowers, but two colleagues agreed that the wine was drier – and even less fruity – than we expected. The palate definitely lacks more than a bit of depth. The wine seems almost watery, and the lower acid of both grapes is evident, making it a “smooth” wine, so I guess the label wasn’t entirely lying. The disjointed aromatic, watery, and low acid leads me to think that this wine is made for sipping. It should also be served as cold as possible to at least give an illusion of some zippiness. Or add ice and a lemon! Seriously. This isn’t a terrible wine. It doesn’t shout bargain, but it certainly whispers it. A couple of days later, one of my colleagues got a bit of this hairspray character on the finish which I didn’t really taste, but it seemed to disappear once I superchilled it.",

The palate is juicy, light and has a bit of tartness. I prefer more zip to my off-dry Riesling, but the slightly more tropical expression coupled with the low acid gives this wine a bit more of a relaxed edge, almost like a Riesling-Torrontes lovechild. Low acid whites always scream summer evenings to me. Perfect, considering the crazy amount of no rain this city has been having. It’s weird – all you need is that one weirdly and noticeably warm day, and then it feels like it’s all downhill from there.",

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma class – Section 1 – Week 8] A taste of this guy and I understood what Oz Clarke meant with his vivid description of Viognier: “If you wanted serious, swooning wine, with texture as soft and thick as apricot juice, perfume as optimistic and uplifting as mayblossom, and a savoury sour creamy richness like a dollop of crème fraîche straight from the ladle of a smiling farmer’s wife – in other words, a wine which just oozed sex and sensuality – Condrieu, from the Viognier grape, was it.” – “Wine Grapes”, by Oz Clarke This is just one paragraph. Oz Clarke waxes poetic about how hot and bothered he gets by (good) Viognier, and so I hopped on that train and thought this was Viognier. A nose from what I thought was more citrus and stone fruit dominated was more green fruit-centric in the experienced mind of the instructor (although there was a agreed-upon and marked nectarine character), but I was correct in detecting a yoghurt-y baked custard sort of characteristic both on the nose and palate, stemming from the good ol’ malolactic fermentation. I’m guessing that this is what Oz might be referring to with the whole crème fraîche thing. (Condrieu is still on the spit bucket list.) That, and this isn’t exactly what I think of when I think of Pinot Blanc. I finally understand the whole comparison to Chardonnay, but most Pinot Blancs I’ve had have been simple, fruity, lighter in body, and have never reached this complexity. Combined with the fact that “Pinot Blanc” from Alsace may actually be a blend of that and Auxerrois (and in some cases may be all Auxerrois and no Pinot Blanc at all, much like Trebbiano d’Abruzzo), and you have a sad and ignored little grape that gets beat up by all the other macho grapes after school. The colour and ripeness makes sense to me, here, because Alsace (and I assume southwest Germany by extension, assuming no strong geographical difference) is generally a dry and sunny area. Sunny areas in southern Germany can lead to riper  and fuller-bodied styles of the variety. I recall week 2 – my embarrassing guess of Alsace Riesling as some oddly bright Chardonnay. This was a fantastic and unique wine. Don’t go chasing it down anytime soon, because the heartbreaking fact is that German Pinot Blancs are rare in this market (maybe one in the BCL), and the shape of the Bocksbeutel inconveniences both restaurants and storage units. That didn’t stop Mateus, but this isn’t Mateus. This is a unique wine with a label that’s difficult to read despite its simplicity, and sadly enough, with the slow progression of wine culture in BC, we probably won’t be seeing wines of this specific nature any time soon.

I thought it was some really weird Muscadet at first – which is inherently neutral – but then I went back to this one after smelling the second wine and I shamefully crossed out my first guess. Coteaux du Giennois is down there with Quincy, Reuilly, and Menetou-Salon as the forgotten hard-to-pronounce children of the Central Vineyards in the Loire, overshadowed by the better-known and much more fashionable Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé. Coteaux du Giennois is one of those extras you never think you’re gonna come across – so much that I didn’t bother taking notes on this area during my big Loire marathon last week – but hey: it turns out one or two of these wines exist in our market. It’s to the northeast of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé, equating to a wine region that’s very much inland from the Atlantic and one of the most rainy and continental regions in the Loire. And 2011 was a tough year for the Loire, as we saw from other wines in our flights, so this was surprisingly appetizing. I’m not sure if it’s just the style of the appellation or its terroir, but the wine had a bit more volume and less restraint than your typical Loire Sauv Blanc, like the modern Sancerres that I’ve come across, so much that there was a minor discussion on how this wine had something inherently un-Sancerre-y about it. There came the intense citrus and green fruit with a grassiness and a whisper of brine, with a very well-balanced acidity along with a savoury vein. The wine was undeniably very good quality, and that was even when I thought it was Muscadet, which is rarely in that camp of quality. Also, $22? Killer price. Henri Bourgeois makes a Sancerre for $37 which is ~*~delicious~*~, but this most certainly is fantastic value.

The fuller-bodied and ripe red fruit along with the fair amount of acidity shouted New Zealand to me, and the guess of Martinborough was something I sort of partially pulled from thin air. Apparently Martinborough Pinots tend to be the most Burgundian, tending towards spice and plummy fruit, while Marlborough is lighter and more cheery in its red fruit. Central Otago Pinot Noir expresses itself toward that darker end of the red fruit spectrum and usually has a bit of a green note which I’ve heard manifests itself in a sage-like aroma. Central Otago is the style that lands in between Marlborough and Martinborough, I suppose. I guess the bit of greenness has to do with the fact that Central Otago is the southernmost winemaking region in the world which makes it cooler than the other Pinot-centric regions of New Zealand. Here there was little to no herbal character but there was a hint of floral and developing leatheriness happening in the glass. I quite liked it – there was enough acid to balance the ripe red fruit, unlike the second wine in our flight, which was sort of just flabby with its belly lying out. Like a Josh.

I guess a little irony is worth mentioning here: a wine like this is, of course, good quality, but it was chosen because this wine in particular needed quite a lot of “meddling” to get to where it is. High sugars and low alcohol means a couple of things: added sulphites will be less effective with some being bound to sugar particles, so as a result, more sulphites need to be added. Careful filtration is also a must, because stray yeasts can royally screw things up. And so on, and so on as high as those blue slated slopes go. German Riesling isn’t expensive for no reason, you guys. I’m treading on broken wine glass here, because I’m afraid any description will be inaccurate here, but I will say that the sugar-acid balance was great. That’s probably the first thing I look for in German Riesling. The characteristics I picked up on were more Mosel-like, opposed to the juicier, rounder Rheingau – more mineral driven, and crisp.

Best most expensive game ever. Woot woot. And it also gives them a chance to try a wine they don’t really want to pay for. So everyone wins. Sort of. Initially, I saw that the wine that was picked was this beautiful deep lemon – beautiful only because everything I’ve seen lately has been boring pale lemon wines with boring noses to boot. What struck me next was the interesting nose – overripe apples (or what my colleague called “bruised”) were what I noticed first, with this super intriguing undertone of oxidized nuttiness that was almost sherry-like in character. We also detected a touch of honey, and my colleague also noticed some notes of fennel except I have no idea what fennel smells like so I just nodded. The ripe nose instantly made me think of a Spätlese, and the honey almost made me think of something late harvest-y that I had before (a colleague from another job even compared it to a Tokaji), but the palate made me think otherwise. Pretty much everything about the mouthfeel threw me off my initial suspicions. I did guess (correctly) the Old World at first, and then Germany (which was wrong). She hinted to me that the wine was from France. Then, she said that I was right having guessed that it was from the Loire. I then correctly guessed that it was Vouvray, and subsequently I rejoiced. Yes! Friday night success!!! The acidity was just strong enough to keep it in balance, although I could tell that it was going. I’m both afraid and curious to see what would happen to the already ripe flavours and slight oxidized nose with some more age – that, and the acidity. I’d just say to drink it now, silly. I’ve only ever had few Vouvray wines in the past, all of ranging qualities, but I’ve noticed that all of them having this sort of “teasing” quality, whether it be from the nose or the sweetness – and not that sort of “bad teasing” quality either, where sometimes you feel a wine straddles the line between several identities and doesn’t fully commit to a character – but instead, makes this intrigue an identity in itself (or maybe I’m just bullshitting). That being said: if this wine were a person, it would be Cersei Lannister. Oh God, yes. It’s perfect. I guessed a 30 dollar wine, but it’s really 42. It’s a strange and intriguing wine worth trying if you have the bones, but I’m sure there are other sort-of-just-as-complex Vouvray wines that don’t break the bank. I think.

Although decently balanced in terms of structure – and I’ll give it that much – there was something on the flavours of this wine that happened to strike both my “odd” and “boring” cards. The lightness of the red fruit disappointed me (although perhaps more typical for old world rosés?), and it wouldn’t be so bad if it weren’t for the strange peppery and woody notes I got on the nose. I also got this slightly unbalanced metallic tartness on the palate which normally wouldn’t bother me as much, but when combined with the weird nose, I decided that the best thing about this wine might just be the pretty colour. Save your money for something more exciting. I really hope this isn’t just because I don’t like rosés: I hope to try this again some day and rate this wine again.

The floral notes are well-echoed into the palate with this touch of bitter citrus rind. What was interesting was the acidity, which was lower than what I would have expected from a Sauvignon Blanc. Although an Old World wine, I’ve heard interesting comments about the fact that this wine sort of bridges between the Old and New World styles, being more fruity and outgoing in character. Although the shorter-than-expected length was a letdown, the character of the wine was prominent enough to outdo that flaw, and who’s going to be be paying attention to the length of a wine in a backyard full of non-wine-drinkers anyways? Okay, fine. If you’re one of those people.  What’s great about this wine is that it hits all the dimensions  that you expect (and does it well) for $20. I predict that the BC white blend might play out as more popular tonight compared to this one, but we’ll see. Then again, we have tons of wine after these two. I can definitely see this being a go-to spring-summer wine for 20 bones. Definitely worth a try at this price point.",

That being said, both the fruits (cherry, raspberry) and the non-fruits (earth, mustiness, spice) were satisfied hanging with each other in the glass, and the high acid on the palate was well-balanced. The tannin must have been as well, because it was lower than I had recorded, me putting down med- while the instructor agreed on med. Some of my classmates put this as very good quality.

The wine had a delicious kernel and nutty component, with some subtle vanilla notes and an undertone of stone fruit. There was also a distinct creamy lees component going on, and the whole wine seemed almost like an Old World New World intermediary for Chardonnay (although still retaining a dominant New World identity), sort of what I get with BC. This is exactly what happened the same time last year – I think the times leading into summer are my Chardonnay months, and the creamy dairy-like texture on this wine really hit the spot (although we have to spit the spot right back out into a spit bucket so it’s not like that lasts for long anyways).

Blind tasting is really tough – I mean, the light colour but built structure was obviously at least Nebbiolo-like, but every little thing plays into your personal bias: “maybe THIS time it’ll be Chile! It has to!” I’m obviously always correct. Xynomavro is often compared with Nebbiolo – the deceivingly light colour, red fruits, and backbone are all too familiar. The name literally means “acid black”, and it’s obvious that this wine had time to soften in the bottle, leaving nuances of red fruit balanced by earth and spice. A couple of classmates liked it even so much as to put it in the “very good” ballpark, but I thought it lacked that complexity and balance to bring it up a notch on the quality scale. In retrospect I should’ve known that a Chilean Pinot would’ve been slightly fuller bodied and a little more poopy, also tending towards the fruitier side. The only thing I really got right was the fact that this wine is red. This was hardly even New World in style, I would say. But, it was my turn to read the tasting notes and apparently mine were nice and succinct; my quality conclusion was pretty much on par with the instructor’s except for my medium(-) finish which really should have been medium. At least I’m doing something right! Who is this wine marketed to? The adventurous. Greek wines from premium producers are relatively new in this market, and are slowly edging their way in.

My unpracticed language skills tell me that the name of this wine roughly translated means something like “the walled vineyard of the seven”. Can we just discuss how Game of Thrones-y that is? I don’t even care if this is a bottle of complete shit – I’m sold by a combination of both nerdy and religious marketing (Also Michel Rolland’s name is on the label but whatever). With a wine that looks and tastes so extracted, I expected the nose to have more than a mere medium intensity. There were developing aromas of earth, must, baking spices, and dark fruits, and my guess of Shiraz was one of uncertainty – although I did think northern Rhône at one point. The deep colour usually alludes to either a grape with thick skins (and/or small berry sizes) or deliberate extraction. I did note that the nose had some Malbec-y characteristics, but the black and blue fruits were supported by a deeper, darker, and stronger structure. Low and behold – it wasn’t just Malbec or Cabernet or Syrah – it was three (or four, depending on who you are) Bordeaux grapes with their foreign cousins. I was surprised that this was only $25 – I find it’s tough to get good extraction at that price. A large proportion of the class slid it into the “very good” category, which isn’t surprising to me at all – but my first instinct was the “good” category as there was a slight bitterness on the finish that I feel may have stemmed from that deliberate extraction. Blah blah blah. Game of Thrones. (Also see here, though.) A coworker may or may not be convinced to watch at least the first season with me and another coworker, and I actually can’t wait.

We’re virtually halfway for sessions this unit, and I feel like I haven’t even studied anything yet. Today’s sparkling-centric class mainly concerned the vineyard, where the main topics included grape varieties and vinification. Fun stuff. The cue cards have begun, and learning which diseases that each grape is susceptible to is sort of fun in a stupid way. We tasted a Californian blanc de noirs, a vintage Champagne, a Riesling Deutscher Sekt, a Cava with a large proportion of Chardonnay, a Cava with very little Chardonnay, and a sparkling Vouvray (this one was corked). Analyzing sparkling wine is evidently becoming a little more tricky than analyzing still wines. Differences can be super subtle, and there’s so much more texture going on. You have to pay attention to the bubbles before the liquid goes flat in the glass, and the alcohol is generally always on the lower side of the spectrum – so you have to train yourself to taste the holistic difference between a sparkling wine with 12% abv, 12.5% abv, or 13% abv, because those small stair steps could reveal the difference between an Old World and New World sparkler. Hence my confusion with the first wine we tasted. Practicing is going to be so expensive. Do I have to spit out everything? Life since the last week’s class has been pretty swell. There’s this city-wide festival that takes place during a couple of weeks this time of year called Dine Out Vancouver (hence the accelerated amounts of sometimes-annoying food pictures on Facebook), and so a couple of friends and I went to Whet on Granville Island which was cool. I retried the latest vintage of the wine that spurred me on to – well – wine (Burrowing Owl Syrah), and I think it was still good. But my memories of such things oozed out of my head from trying my best not to giggle at our server, who endured our half-joking conversation about creating a real-life Hunger Games. And because we aren’t a homogeneously alcohol-guzzling group, our improvised post-dinner plans involved us going to Chapters, where there was no shortage of us coming up with games that probably made us look suspiciously drunk, anyways. Source: http://sittingatthecrossroads.wordpress.com/ Source: http://sittingatthecrossroads.wordpress.com/ Work-filled weekend, but I did get to visit the Sardine Can, which was a quaint change from the mayhem that is Saturday night in Gastown. It almost feels like it’s in a weird corner protected by a forcefield where you can watch the rest of the street, which was surprisingly (or perhaps unsurprisingly) filled with party-goers who have the supreme ability to brace the cold in nothing but short dresses or douchey muscle shirts. I applaud you. And my glass of Rias Baixas and snack-ins made just the fanciest popcorn as I watched you trot across the street in high heels, with you attempting to avoid getting run over by that one cab. I’m such an asshole.   I prepared for Tuesday. There was a big industry tasting in the early afternoon, and then I went and napped at home before heading out to the grand staff party. I got a headache somewhere in the middle of the day which prevented the shameless second and third glassfuls of Rioja and Beaujolais. Though my ridiculous idea of bringing note cards to the event with the intention of scribbling down tasting notes had failed thanks to a sad little spilled glass of beer, I do remember tasting a young Savennières which didn’t seem very intense until you felt both the weight and the strange savoury wet wooliness that it left on your palate. Quite the wine, and quite the cheeky youth. This weekend is going to be busy, and I can’t wait for yet another do-nothing Monday.",

A similar palate, with just the slightest itty bit of salted almond. I can’t help but compare dry Madeira to Sherry, since they’re essentially cousins on some level. This was definitely brighter than many if not all Sherries, and definitely none of the signature acetaldehyde characteristics – instead, there was more of a typical cooked citrus and a little more dried fruit. And no one really expects the acid out of Madeira, because such a wine always gives an impression of ancientness, and we subsequently associate that age with lower acid.

The ripe red and black fruits with the green pepper capiscum aromas totally reminded me of a Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon I’ve had, so I went there. I mean, it’s definitely closer than the previous wine in this lineup, so that’s something. The riper and finer tannins in this wine (which even I picked up on) pointed to a riper and warmer climate. If the last wine wasn’t New World, then this one had to be one. Come on, throw me a bone, here. My tasting notes were a little bit off this week, and I had exactly the same problem as the first wine – I underestimated the levels for tannin, alcohol, and body, only giving them the medium card. I swear I don’t do the same for people. At least I don’t think I do. Oh man. Anyways, these wines were chosen to contrast wines that were similar in both quality and make-up. The point was that it’s (nearly) impossible to imitate a quality wine via grapes (i.e. shitty soulless wine can be too-easily similar to one another) because there are so many other factors: climate, weather, soil, mesoclimate, and so on; and it shows in the finished product. Clearly, this point could be better supported without my constant guesses for Chile. Thanks a lot, brain. Here, have more alcohol.",

So I was more than excited to see its whiteness (or goldness, rather) poured into the glass, especially because I think this might be the only one in the local market. I wasn’t even sure what it would taste or smell like. Citrus? Raisins? Vanilla pudding? Mangoes? Puppies? Toothpaste? Steak? It was interestingly youthful, and surprisingly not very intense, with mostly vague hints to sultana raisins, spiced notes, and baked somethings rather. There was a hint of something tropical or ripe – peach? Mango? Not particularly exuberant enough for me to really match it up. But there was a marked mineral quality which I also couldn’t exactly define – but it was definitely there. Along with hints of nuts, but nothing wild. Very unique, though. The wine was essentially a flabby and unserious delight, with a syrupy body that didn’t overly cloy, thank goodness. The instructor displayed this in the flight of six so that we could mentally compare this to other white fortified wines: this clearly wasn’t the nutty waltz of Sherry nor was this the floral or flamboyant prance of something Muscat-based, so this filled a different niche entirely. Sweet and weird and minerally but not overly fruity. I’m fearing having to buy this again just to come up with proper descriptors, only because I know I can’t finish this by myself and no one would want to finish it with me.",

The most kingly appellation in the southern Rhône can offer some level of variety like other southern Rhône blends, allowing something like 13 different grapes (18 including mutations) into its wines, with top producers varying their recipes dramatically. Château de Beaucastel, for example, is known for making a Châteauneuf-du-Pape with all of the allowed varieties, while Chateau Rayas makes one that’s virtually a Grenache clubhouse. The most evolved wine of the bunch of course had more leather, nuts, spice, and earth to match the stewed and dried fruit. The palate of course had acid on the softer side and a fatter body, but slightly lopsided and chalky tannins were rather uneven. Delicious and flavourful finish.

The de facto red grape, and, in the game of ice cream flavours, is essentially the bucket of quintessential vanilla. In the theme of its masculinity, it has thick skins and relatively small berries, leading to a high pip to pulp ratio and a high amount of phenolics which contributes to darker-coloured wines and high tannin, respectively. Generally resistant to rot, and planted everywhere. The poster child for red wines, really, and a great vehicle for terroir. But despite its reputation for huge wines, it tends to be on the med to med+ scale in terms of its weight. So my mind is finally at ease when I come across slightly lighter versions. And here we have a classic Australian example: typical dark fruit characteristics with hints of green (eucalyptus, mint) are the main notes, with spice in the back seat. The structure is impressive for a warm climate (acidification? If so, done well), and the concentration is good. There is a lightness or a refreshing quality despite the alcohol and body. So far, I’ve seen this pattern of relative lightness and elegance (but not lacking in strength) with Margaret River wines, especially with Sandalford’s Shiraz. Interestingly refreshing and almost relieving, with the trend of increasing alcohol levels of the decades both from climate change and stylistic changes. I think. It’s also interesting how similar in structural components that this was to a Saint-Estèphe we tried, but are still completely different and unique.",

Besides the 2005 Château Clerc-Milon I had earlier this year at the Vancouver Wine Fest, I can’t say that I’ve tasted legit classed Bordeaux before. The whole thing is an antiquated list that still dictates prices and prestige at most, so it’s cool getting to try something that has that ingrained reputation. That might seem backwards for someone who studies wine, where it seems like I’d want to try more esoteric and weird things, but Bordeaux is one of those regions where exports are so crucial and centric to its spirit, that it’s interesting and equally as important to understand what the hell people are pulling their dicks out of their pants for. I have a soft spot for Saint-Estèphe because it’s the least popular of the four royal communes of the left bank in Bordeaux, with Pauillac and Margaux playing king and queen, and Saint-Julien serving as an intermediate between the two both in style and location. I’ve read a wine encyclopedia describing Saint-Estèphe as the “least sexy of the Médoc’s famous four communes”, and I suppose the description comes from its more northerly location and therefore a slightly more uptight profile, with higher acidity and more of a graze to its texture compared to the other communes. This fourth-growth was a classic style. Brooding black fruit and dried floral flavours joined an earthy spiciness. The body wasn’t particularly heavy but still had lush texture, and the frame as well as the concentration exhibited a fair bit of brawn compared to the other wines in our flights. Tannins were chocolatey and ripe as per the vintage. I haven’t done a #winetrax in a while, so let’s call this one “Daniel in the Den” by the Bastille.",

I mean, it’s nice to hang out with friends, eat candy, carve pumpkins, and eat pumpkin-flavoured things, but seeing drunk-ass half-dressed teenagers à la Mean Girls gets tiring, annoying, and mind-grating, and all I want to do on Halloween is lock myself in my room and do homework. Of course that all changes when you go on Facebook seeing everyone have fun but you, and you wish you weren’t such a bitter old man stuck in a college-boy’s body. I’m glad it’s raining this weekend. ALL YOUR FACE PAINT IS MELTING OFF. Of course, I’m working on actual Halloween. I’m going to see if work will let me wear bloody things and carry around a bloody prop-hammer-axe-not-really-a-prop. So I thought I’d have my co-workers blind me with a wine after having been inspired by the amazing WineAlign blind tasting competition videos as well has not having done it in a while. Geez – it’s such a seemingly pretentious and obscure talent, but being able to identify a wine by smell and taste is so cool. It’s also something I love about wine – the fact that it’s a liquid expression of where it’s from; a drinkable gustatory and olfactory stamp of an area, whether that be climate, grape, terroir, or particular winemaking. It’s like taking a picture with a camera that records aromas and flavours. This wine in particular was quite Old World in style. Minerality was quite evident on the nose, and funnily enough, I first noticed a nuance of stone fruit. I let the wine warm up a bit to release some aromas, which were more citrus and grassy – but not pungent in that New World style. I really did enjoy the nose more than the palate. The palate was an explosion of tart lemons and mineral, and the acidity was med to med+ at most, the length was average if not below, and the alcohol was a little bit hot and disjointed which was weird considering the alcohol content (12% ABV). The mineral characteristics screamed Old World, the supposed hot alcohol brought me to the south, and the Sauvignon characteristics brought me to something of a white Bordeaux (Gascogne – close enough),  but I recall having a fleeting thought of Albariño or Macabeo before I put it in my mouth. Quite young so the vintage was a no-brainer (2010), and I guessed a wine around 20 dollars. Needless to say, I beamed when I guessed the wine correctly. It’s slightly easier because we’re all familiar with the wines in the store. Gros Manseng is a bit obscure though. Can’t say I or many of my colleagues or wine geek friends have ever had any if not one, ever. The citrus in this wine pops so much that it’s almost a replacement for squeezing lemon over your food (or matching it with food that has lemon). I can’t help but think that this would go well with seafood, or in particular, a Filipino dish called “pancit” – it would be a cool calamansi/lemon replacement, and this wine gave me that tart kick (I’m probably just excited because pairing Filipino food with wine is so tough – stay tuned for an article). That being said, the wine without food is a bit sassy. Loses points for balance, but it’s definitely not a bad wine.",

I spent more than I should have on spirits last fall because of the diploma exam in November, and I still have so many leftovers. I’m trying to force myself to sip on some of the hard stuff whenever I feel like a drink, but wine is definitely the drink of choice, and I’m most certainly beer’d out for the time being. Craving something a bit riper, my colleagues were surprised when I wanted something as loud as Gew, but I settled on this because I haven’t done the Pinot Gris in a while and I wanted something with a bit of meat on the bones without being, well, Gewurz. The wine suits almost exactly what I was craving. There is a bit of sweetness that sits on the fence between the camps of dry and off-dry, and the wine has a bit of typical oiliness. The juicy stone fruit (with a suggestion of mango) on the palate is pleasantly replaced by a vibrant minerality and just a sparkle of medium acid. There is a bit of bitter pith character on the finish which perhaps stemmed from the extraction of the phenols. Or something like that. There is always something that I find so strange but relaxed and effortless about Alsatian Pinot Gris. It’s not the grassiness of Sauvignon Blanc that exudes to me the archetypal image of a sunny green meadow, but the relaxed texture and structure of Pinot Gris. Sort of the stuff you’d drink to Hey Ocean!’s “Bicycle”. I’m really in love with fuller-bodied styles of Pinot Gris because it’s exactly what people don’t expect. They are the honeyed and exotic side of the coin to the Pinot Grigio of Italy. Oz Clarke (in “Grapes & Wines”) goes on to say that some have “the merest suggestion of something slightly unwashed […] many of the most memorable wines have something slightly ‘incorrect’ about them.” It’s a bit of a strange misfit in a sea of fresh Pinot Grigio-style wines, ironic because of its inevitable European history and connoisseur-like familiarity.

We’re handed our room keys as we get off of the bus, and the front desk worker stops me as I walk through the lobby. She specifically stops me asks if I’m Josh – I say yes, obviously, and I wonder whether or not it’s because she’s secretly an undercover agent, and that this is the beginning of some really exciting spy film where I would discover my undiscovered penchant for leaping off buildings and using my wine knowledge to save the world. God, I need water. I know she’s asking because there was some sort of logistical airplane snafu with my friend Kayla (who was also a scholarship recipient last year) which led to her having to get someone to drive her up to Geneva from Elmira. Thus, she missed Villa Bellangelo but beat me to our hotel room, and I couldn’t help but wonder how she described me to the front desk. The vaguely sober bald asian with glasses? The guy whose head looks like the inspiration behind the Minions of Despicable Me? We freshen up before our next winery visit; I decide my weird lumberjack shirt should be sufficient despite the fact that I see everyone else changing into evening dresses and platform shoes. I ask Kayla but she tells me to do me, so I do me. This was beautiful but I was squinting for the entire evening. We arrive at Ventosa, receive welcoming packages, and taste two different kinds of delicious local cider. I’m supremely fearful of dozing off at this point because I normally would, considering all this stimuli we’ve received so far, but I find myself engrossed in the current theme: Finger Lakes Women. Diversity. Looking back at the conference now, I’d say that this was definitely one of my favourite sessions, especially since a lack of diversity was a current criticism for both the previous year, and for the wine industry in general. They really went the full mile here, and even the cider and provided cheese were also crafted by women. We’re reminded that Seneca Falls, just a mere 15 minutes away, was huge for the birth for feminism in 1848. The speakers included Marti Macinski, owner and winemaker of Standing Stone Vineyards; Jenna Lavita, winemaker at Ventosa Vineyards; Erica Paolicelli, partner at Three Brothers Winery & Estates; Liz Leidenfrost, 3rd generation owner and winemaker at Leidenfrost vineyards; and Kathleen Deys, biochemist and grape geneticist. Amazing dinner was crafted by Heather Tompkins. Huzzah! THE STORIES! After a bit of a vineyard excursion, we went back for dinner with the panel participants. It was at this time I decided to stop taking notes and maybe swallow for once. Bad idea? Maybe. Nah. Me picking underripe grapes. After dinner, they unexpectedly open up the tasting room. It finally (?) feels like I’m dying and I can hardly take a proper tasting note, and instead I’m craving anything bubbly. Ventosa 2011 Lemberger (Seneca Lake, Finger Lakes, New York) $24\nBlack cherry, tobacco, dried herbs, lots of tomato leaf. Generous acid. Spinning head. This particular wine won the Governor’s Cup for best red wine at the 2015 New York Wine & Food Classic competition, despite encouragement that Jenna Lavita shouldn’t grow Lemberger, or something like that. Stony Lonesome Estate Reserve 2014 Grüner Veltliner (Finger Lakes, New York) $14\nWhite pepper and potpourri. Dry, round, spice, green apple. Where’s the water at? Standing Stone 2014 Dry Vidal (Finger Lakes, New York) $14\nThough I have tried (and liked) various Standing Stone wines throughout the conference, this is probably my least fave of theirs. Lovely white peach and orange blossom, but strangely boozy without much depth or concentration. Slight effervescence provides lift. Though my roommate decides to be the sane one and sleep back at the hotel, some of us head to Lake Drum brewing which is just a block or two away. The beautiful space is co-run by Jenna Lavita. What a superstar. I obviously head for the local weird shit. Give me Brett! Give me all of him! #YES Summary: darts with The Vineyard Trail and Christine; Dancing Queen; delicious beer; and raw vegetables. That is all you need to know. The next day we head to Anthony Road. Beautiful scenery, and rolling around in the grass. We’re indeed greeted with a glass of rosé, we have a tour of the vineyards and winemaking facilities, and then we taste two sets of wines: an unoaked Chardonnay against one that was fermented on skins, and then a dry Riesling against one that was fermented on its skins. A traditional Geisenheim clone of Riesling on a V. riparia x V. rupestris roostock, I think. Well, according to Google. Next: Fox Run.

Racy with nice red fruit intensity to balance the tart lemons. Good morning! Anthony Road 2014 Unoaked Chardonnay (Finger Lakes, New York) $17\nZippy but not sharp; a hint of butter? Yellow apple, and a hint of freshly cut grass. Maybe suffers from just a hint of SO2 that needs to blow off? Anthony Road 2014 Skin Ferment Chardonnay (Finger Lakes, New York) $? [unreleased]\nCompared to its naked counterpart, this version is softer on the nose, and then chewier, mellower, and rounder on the palate. Anthony Road 2014 Riesling Dry (Finger Lakes, New York) $18\nChalky. White flowers, most notably, with an intense spritz of elegantly fruity and gummy white peach on the palate. A bejewelled sword, or something. Anthony Road 2014 Skin Ferment Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York) $? [unreleased]\nKind of like if the previous wine put on a hip autumn sweater. More spice and gently oxidative autumnal fruit, or sugarless apple pie. A hint of something ashy. Ugh finally an album cover for my mandolin covers of 90s hits",

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 2: Loire Valley] The last time I’ve had an old world Cabernet Franc was over a year ago when I had a Saumur-Champigny in class (wine class, that is). I’m sure I’ve forgotten what the classic example tastes like which is a weird shame because the style of wine, on paper, seems relatively uncomplicated and definitive: raspberry-dominated with red fruits, pencil shavings and perhaps brettanomyces amongst the earth, leafy greens, a medium depth of colour and body, and noticeable but reined tannin. Maybe I’m not used to more aged examples – or just better examples in general – of the style, because the wine seemed much more full-bodied and in the darker black cherry fruit range than I expected. Sure, there was that raspberry quality all the descriptions rave about, but the fruits seemed much more stewed and evolved to me, and there was less leafiness than I expected (which I guess is a good thing), enough to convince me to propose the possibility of a Côt, which is essentially Loire Malbec. That being said, I’ve heard a similar note from someone else about another one of his wines, so maybe it’s a stylistic thing. Maybe I’m completely missing what Cabernet Franc is all about – but so is everyone else, because it’s basically the antithesis of Apothic – dry, lighter, leafy, rough, hipster. Only popular in its homeland, apparently – perhaps I’ll find Cab Franc as a new grape to evangelize. My off guard-ness aside, the wine was delicious. Structurally, the acid was high but in equilibrium with the fruit, and the tannins were relatively high but quite fine for a grape that can often be green – the fineness of the vintage and winemaking really showed, here. Youthful flavour characteristics are starting to develop the deep earthy and leathery tones reminiscent of a BDSM party in a raspberry bush. Can that be a term? “Cat’s pee on a gooseberry bush” is SO 2002.",

This is an intense, big, and well-concentrated wine that made me fall in love with Zinfandel, much to the dismay of other wine enthusiasts who gave me a look whenever I told them Zinfandel was my favourite grape (at the time). Unfortunately, it was like a love never re-discovered, because as a new wine drinker back then, I was ignorant of the fact that cheap, good, and concentrated Zinfandel doesn’t exist or is hard to find. Through consumer patterns, I often find that Zinfandel is a polarizing grape that I’m almost afraid to suggest to people in fear of a 1/2 chance of automatic disgust due to some form of negative reputation. Quite ironically, the grape almost grows in the same chancy fashion: the individual berries in a bunch of Zinfandel grapes ripen at different times, often resulting in overripe grapes if one has to wait for all of the berries to be at least acceptably ripe: such a gamble, and thusly I’m calling Zinfandel “the Gambler” grape. Subsequent adventures in Zinfandel land have made me fall out of love for the variety (or maybe I haven’t had enough), but this is the wine that always makes me rediscover its masculine charm and potential.",

It’s one of the only wine brands I knew before I started getting into wine (and more specifically, their Shiraz), and it’s probably one of the brands that is well-known in the wine world. Winecouver states it perfectly – I would say that the touch of residual sugar (in the wines I’ve had, most notably the Shiraz and Bubbles) makes it so welcoming to the non-wine drinking masses, and combined with (what I would guess is) inexpensive winemaking and marketing so brilliant that it makes its way into marketing textbooks, you have a success that angers no one but the wine savvy, who make a Shakespearean grimace into the distance and wonder why people aren’t drinking other wines. Yellow Tail (from what I’ve had, anyways) isn’t bad wine per se – it’s just horrendously boring, and more than often, a bad example of what a typical wine of a certain varietal should be. It’s like the McDonalds of wine. It’s not bad food, but it’s not a great example of what a “standard” or “real” American burger should be like. All finger-pointing aside, I noted that this sparkling wine was “good value if cheap”, and that was before I knew it was Yellow Tail. My heart sank when the big reveal came, but whatever. Surprisingly decent if not good balance and intensity. And length. But sometimes all that shit doesn’t matter and maybe you just need a good bubbly that everyone doesn’t need to appreciate when everyone’s half-drunk, anyways.

Just, like, a random thought. It’s Halloween on Friday or whatever. I don’t remember much about this wine including why it was chosen in our first flight of four. What I remember is that the flavour profile was very similar to the second wine in our flight but with slightly more complexity with scents of cigar boxes and brushes of mint along with the developing fruit. Now that I remember it, there was probably a discussion on how wine from Graves, which is in the southern part of Bordeaux, generally matures quicker than more structured wine from the left bank. Perhaps evident with the classmate who read her notes – she thought this was from the 2006 vintage and at a level of outstanding quality. I and some others couldn’t find as much complexity as she did, and indeed this was generally agreed upon as a level down in quality at “very good”, and very good it was: I remember taking notice that this was great at $37. I thought that this had notable intensity on the palate with a moderate acid level hardly concealing fantastic flavours of red fruit, plum, and hints of leather and cigar boxes.

It’s sort of like liquid velvet. It’s a curvy and seductive wine. The wine is fortified Grenache, so, much like the previous wine in our flight, the wine’s process of fermentation had been halted by the fun addition of grape spirit which left it sweet, sort of like when I take several shots of vodka and end up being fun. The joke’s on you, sucka! The aromas are quite pronounced and they easily glide up the nasal cavity to reveal flavours of chocolate, chocolate-covered cherries, black cherries, and a distinct flavour of raspberries and black forest cake. The palate is similar, but there’s a bit more acid than I expect from something Grenache-based (and definitely unlike the fortified Muscat we had previous to this one) which gives it a bit of teasing structure. The palate is just as loud as the nose with the intensity of flavours, and the medium tannins are very fine-grained and soft. Again with the velvet thing. (I wrote it like 9 times in my notes.)",

This wine was one for celebrating, plus served as a lifting brightness for one of those weeks that wasn’t so bad in theory but was shitty anyways. Sometimes you can’t explain why it brings you down, and sometimes you can’t explain why good wine can bring you back up. Plus, after failing at identifying an Alsatian Riesling in last week’s WSET Diploma class, I couldn’t help but try another one. Too intriguing to pass up. Without revealing Game of Thrones spoilers – where Cersei Lannister is dry Vouvray, this wine is like Daenerys Targaryen, which is fitting as I catch up on the latest episode of this season: nervy and unsure in youth, with intensity and an acidic backbone – great potential strength and opulence with age. As this wine opened up at room temperature I got similar “buttery” or “musky” notes (almost reminding me of a still Cava or vague Chardonnay) that I got in another 2010 Alsatian Riesling I tried earlier this week. I put these terms in quotation marks because those words don’t seem very Riesling-typical to me – after much mulling and smelling I’m deciding to use the descriptors of “honey” and “musk”, and even so far as to call it slightly nutty, but not in an oxidized sense. it’s a very subtle combination of aromas, and it’s even akin to a smell of caramelized sugar and Granny Smith apples. It’s almost like smelling a cold and sugarless apple pie. I find it interesting that I can spend time analyzing and swirling this wine, yet I can also understand how someone else can think this tastes like sour apple juice. Even more, I think I enjoy wines with a balanced acidic backbone sometimes more so than their aged counterparts, which I can find often too mellow and nutty. Perhaps I’m just drinking the wrong vintages of things. Oh well – only one way to find out, right?! *glug*",

It’s a versatile one. This is the dark and leathery route. Chosen as a good example of this grape, the wine had a deep but balanced extraction, a long length, good structure, but lacked a bit of finesse and elegance. I underestimated both the complexity and quality, and I’m ashamed to say that at first I thought this was a Zinfandel. Lots to learn. Side-to-side comparisons help a lot. Ribera del Duero is very continental, but a high altitude can tame the hot temperatures. Large amounts of sunlight lead to better ripening while acidity is still retained due to cool nights from both continentality and altitudes. Wines from here are also of the “Tinto Fino” variety of Tempranillo – darker and more powerful than Rioja in the northeast, but from what I’ve tasted, not as powerful as the “Tinta de Toro” clone to the southwest. Great value for 30 dollars. For a grape with overwhelmingly great potential viticulturally and, well, taste-wise, it’s a shame that the majority of consumers don’t know what the hell Tempranillo is.

Unlike being called for giving out an answer in some useless university class, it wasn’t as bad as I thought – I’m more confident about giving conclusions than individual tasting note parameters. My apparent weaknesses lie in being a bit too vague and poetic with my language: I need to stick to using the objective column descriptors for intensity, and I need to stop saying “nice”. Fuck. I swore that this was some sort of weighty but lightly-oaked Chardonnay from God knows where. It just seemed so distinctive to me. On the nose and palate I got this interesting butter and nutty kernel character (perhaps I was painting myself into an alcoholic corner), but the high acid seemed to come out of nowhere. I knew that should’ve swayed my thoughts but it didn’t. There was also a creamy lees-y texture with slight oxidation. It’s interesting because unsure guesses from the class were thrown all over the place: inexpensive Riesling (I originally scoffed at this but look how wrong I was!), Australian Viognier, Alsatian Pinot Gris, Sémillon, even an unsure guess of Chenin Blanc. The problem is we don’t drink enough Alsatian wines. That’s my problem, at least. My Alsatian Rieslings have been limited to sweet and expensive examples, or dry and much more austere.

I had tried this exact wine for the first time just two days beforehand, and I remember it being fantastic. So fantastic, that I had to snag a bottle for my own to either revel in the newfound glory of a BC wine I might actually crave for once, and also to confirm and do a double-take just in case that moment might’ve been crazy and ephemeral. So I happened to grab a bottle of this after having drinks with old friends – and then beers happened – which was probably not so much of a good idea. I mostly remember drunkenly eating fish tacos, dipping fries in ketchup, and yelling at my best friend and then demanding selfies be taken. Cough. As an attempt to mirror the first time, I opened this closer to room temperature with just a slight chill. Upon viewing, I remember the wine being slightly darker in colour – though I’m not doubting the fact that the first bottle could have been a bit more oxidized (in a good way). I also remembered that the nose was much more – to put it crudely – interesting. Some facets still remain – there are aromas of juicy grapefruit, an herbal-floral character, and an underlying hint of honey and tangerine – but something tells me it was much more intense and honey-driven on the nose the first time around. Perhaps it was just outstanding compared to the other wines in the lineup. Or maybe I’m just horrendously tired? Who knows. The palate matches up much more correctly in my memory – there is a surprisingly intense opening of ripe and almost candied citrus and grapefruit, with juicy acidity and citrus rind flavours falling into a savoury and long dry finish. Impressively, there is a considerable amount of body which makes me marvel at the moderate 12.8% ABV, but this oddity is weirdly double-edged, and the back-palate ends up being quite boozy. That one friend you think doesn’t drink but ends up being the one doing the most shots during that one spring break? This wine. Also this wine: the knight of flowers, because floral and citrus characteristics aren’t often coupled (or thought to be coupled) with unctuousness or brawn. And also because I’m still hung up on the fact that there won’t be any Game of Thrones for a good year or so. The odes to the white Bordeaux blends are almost overdone yet robust versions are often underrated. I often crave the summery Sauvignon Blanc characteristics with the forbearing qualities of a peaty scotch or buttery Chardonnay by the fireplace (in this case – Semillon), and sometimes the heavier versions of white Bordeaux do just that. Like today was actually fine, but my emotions started to falter in the middle of it for no valid reason like a random bug in the code.

I find Halloween @ UBC to be such a pooper, though, because no one dresses up – and even though I sort of hate Halloween, it kinda sucks when you’re all up in the Halloween spirit and end up embarrassed because you’re the only one in a 200-person lecture that decided to dress up. BUT – it sort of works if you’re dressed up as Waldo. Two years in a row. Shh. I made a friend last year by dressing up as Waldo. She still calls me Waldo. So the wine I was blinded with today was quite solid and delicious. At first, the nose was quite smoky in that delicate sense, without overpowering too much of the fruit. Now – although I’ve had a lot of wines (l0l), I still have trouble telling the difference between certain descriptions like oak and spice, but I was pretty sure there was some level of oak in this wine (which I found out later was Slovenian, which I’m not particularly familiar with). The fruit was subdued at first, and opened up after we let it sit for a while. There were some obvious cherry notes, with a bit of bright strawberry and vanilla, like what you get from red fruit roll-ups or fruit-to-go. The smokiness on the nose almost drew me to something Syrah-like, but the palate revealed otherwise. Definitely Old World on the nose. The palate was quite expressive (i.e. the opposite of tight). I found the smoky nose almost disjointed (or unexpected, rather, since I haven’t had much Barbera) with the relatively light body and tannin, and higher acidity. What stuck out to me, along with the beautifully integrated acidity, was the savoury peppery finish, and I was almost tempted to guess Spain, but Italy was where I eventually landed, and was correct. The Barbera grape was my final (and correct!) guess. Botched the year though. Guessed ’06 and beyond backwards, but finally guessed ’09 after like seven guesses. I got too excited. That being said – this was great. I haven’t had much Barbera – but I can say with confidence that this is a good wine. Quite expressive, and I would even age this, but not for very long (1-3 years?). Quite elegant. The acidity is well-integrated. I think this is just a small stretch for its price (I guessed 25-30 dollars), and I would expect just a touch more complexity, but that’s a small flaw. Barbera is one of the few grapes I remember from class: typically low in tannin, high in acidity, and the affinity for (Slovenian) oak.

I’m getting better at confirming my notes and not being a nervous wreck when reading them out loud – and much to my surprise, it turns out that my set of notes was good and mostly true to the wine. And so I was happy! The only thing I didn’t do was come up with a country that this was from. Not enough girth to be Alsatian, nor crisp and neutral to be the style done up as (or done down as) Pinot Grigio. The ones I’ve had from BC have been more obvious in oak (perhaps this isn’t a generalization), and so I was undecided. And it’s weird, because I don’t remember ever having a Pinot Gris so overt in its stone fruit notes. The wine was softer and lower in its acidity, but didn’t hide behind the forms of oak and insipid neutral character that I’m used to. It’s very interesting how a relatively inexpensive bottle can be so informative. Pinot Gris isn’t as popular as Pinot Grigio, but it’s still pretty popular. The former tends to be fuller bodied, spicy, and more concentrated; the latter is usually picked early to retain acidity in exchange for not having ripened its phenolic characteristics. But both grapes tend to straddle the middle parts of the scale – arguably, they hardly reach the low or high scale of anything, including their intensity – they’re safe, pleasantly-sounding grapes, and my classmate cleverly named it the “baby bear’s oatmeal of the wine world”. This wine in particular is somewhere in between the full Alsatian style and the lighter, more neutral fruit-driven ones of Italy. So, a good example. Pinot Grigio is eye roll-inducing, but it’s definitely worth exploring the Gris side of this Pinot. I’ve had stunning examples from Alsace – the fuller-bodied concentrated examples are nothing to shake a stick at; I’ve seen interesting examples from BC as well. Sometimes I feel like I judge the Grigio too much – there is a reason why its likeable, but I wish people would stretch their horizons.

A few New World guesses were thrown around (Argentinian Syrah) along with guesses closer to mine (French Syrah), but the higher acidity and firm structure apparently root it to the Old World.

A region so based in its trade, producers, and viticulture leads to meaty entries in the Oxford Companion to do with who married who to get their name on this Château and so forth, along with the different polysaccharides that Botrytis cinerea produces during its metabolism. It’s literally like reading those hideously long entries in the Bible on family trees (or was that Lord of the Rings?), combined with a university chemistry textbook. I’m only approaching the right bank’s regional entries now as I prematurely decide to open this bottle of Champagne, because I can’t wait and I’m thirsty as fuck. This isn’t the loudest-scented Champagne, but it seems to be revealing itself slightly as it warms up. Ripe apples and baking spice join hints of nuttiness and autolysis. The palate is much more expressive with the apples becoming more baked, the nuttiness being more broad, and a palate that seems like it’s on the higher end of Brut (0-12 g/L); that being said, acid is on the lower side of high, sort of like if Alain Vesselle were Moses, the Red Sea were acidity, and the Israelites were ripe pomaceous fruit. The finish is distinctly floral and mineral, and the finish is relatively long. The wine itself isn’t tremendously complex, but I enjoy the uncomplicated style that still has more personality than the more sterile versions of the bubbly from the same region. Also, can we have a moment to appreciate the hilarious Neopets-esque 30-second music loop on their website? Oh my God, I just discovered a next-song button in the bottom right corner. It just gets better and better. The producer has no mention in the latest edition of Tom Stevenson’s World Encyclopedia of Champagne and Sparkling Wine, but listed are a Georges Vesselle, Jean Vesselle, and a Maurice Vesselle – all in Bouzy, and all grower-producers except for Jean who is an NM. I’m wondering if Alain is the hippie underdog, producing the smallest amounts and opting for music that makes it seem like they do yoga in the vineyards.",

But it made sense: cherry-dominated bright red fruits, some spice, and a slight herbal note. Some deemed it a tad sour but I thought the acidity was better-integrated than other acidic wines I’ve had. The problem, though: when I came back to the wine, the fruitiness was much more pronounced. I raised an eyebrow and noticed a slight confected character which I don’t doubt (but at the same time, hadn’t noticed too much before), but I realized that my tasting note could vaguely represent some form of Beaujolais(-Villages) with partial carbonic maceration giving way to such flavour. Plus that black pepper thing (which I think that I see more in New World Gamay). And I know that the fact that the second wine was a Chianti might have been a bit of a giveaway, but I was being optimistic, which is a weird thing for Beaujolais even though it, well, tastes optimistic. Guesses by other students included Dolcetto and Gamay. The wine itself was simple and fresh. Bright and short sour cherry with whispers of further dried herbal complexity.",

I’m pretty sure I’ve thrown off my whole rhythm and I’m feeling tired at the weirdest moments, so I decided to cannonball right back into wine with a blanket of huge Californian girth. Plus, I’m studying for the certified level of the CMS, which means I’m have to at least try to study the possible wine varieties we’d be given on the tasting exam. I’m cheating because this is half Marsanne and half Viognier, but I really couldn’t help it because this is one of Erin’s favourite wines and apparently it tastes like marshmallows. And I don’t care if it’s the cheap kind of marshmallows, because drinking marshmallows sounds pretty fucking exciting right about now. We also at one point agreed that Treana would be my sassy Mean Girls name, so yeah. The marshmallow thing was no exaggeration – there is judicious oak usage on both the nose and the palate, and there’s a distinct note of orange zest that hides behind the fruity cocktail of baked stone fruit and ripe citrus. There’s nothing old world about this wine – it drinks like liquid love-handles, and the full-bodied wine has a fantastic cleansing nutty savoury quality with just enough acid to boot. The finish is relatively long and nutty, but the alcohol is quite evident. Both unsurprising and personally trivial at this point. It’s a nice alternative flavour profile to the stereotypical fat blob that Californian Chard can be, but with the same body that it can have. I’m sure that this wine is a one-off that the BCL has been dying to get rid of (evident by the shifty-looking price-tags and lack of presence on their website) so I’ll make sure I don’t fall too much in love with this one.",

I don’t know why the jellybeans part sticks with me so much. For some reason, I thought Tavel would be the perfect choice (while everyone else went for the sensible hard liquor and beer route), and though it wasn’t really what I expected for a rosé (at the time), it was still a delicious choice. The appellation has a maximum sugar level of 4 grams per litre – so in theory, the wine is always dry but can give a ripe impression. It served us well, but I’m sure I looked like a total asshat bringing a bottle of French rosé to a university spring break getaway. I’m pretty sure we all got drunk and it was fine, though I’m looking through photos now and realizing how haggard I look. And there I am with that homemade cork-and-wire necklace I made that I thought would be a good idea to wear for a large proportion of the year. Great. The wine has more body than most rosés and just a hint of tannin that frames the ripe fruit.  You often don’t huge complexity even out of the most serious rosé (I’m sure this is arguable), so the flavours that this wine carries is still on the awesome side of the spectrum.",

I’m not entirely sure why – perhaps because it’s versatile, but in such a different way than Riesling or Chardonnay. Riesling noticeably varies most in its sugar; Chardonnay with its weight and flavours. It’s interesting how Chenin can be an unpredictable fellow, producing sparkling wine with unripe grapes for example, sweet wines with slightly riper grapes, and then dry wines with even riper grapes. Or something like that. Even grapes affected with noble rot are quite common, as are late harvest versions. I find Chenin Blanc exciting, but of course there are a lot of uninteresting examples out there. And, like Semillon, there are many premium producers (in the Loire) that make Chenin Blanc worthy for ageing, with a honeyed wet wool and nutty baked apple sort of way – but are indeed boring in youth, which is a shame. By deduction and being the last wine, we knew we were tasting Chenin Blanc, but the oak and buttery characteristics, not unlike some Chardonnay, brought us straight to South Africa, where oak is more common for Chenin Blanc. It is similar to some Chardonnay, with softer apple tones and a interesting funky earthy woolly character. This wine was very good quality for 25 bones. Persistent, structured, and balanced between the fruit and non-fruit components. But maybe I just love Chenin Blanc.",

Let’s just let that old blog post sink in. I can’t find myself to delete or change it because it’s a valid thought in my wine journey: can’t you see newcomers finding Saint-Émilion boring? Saint-Émilion is an appellation on the right bank of Bordeaux, where Merlot is king. Saint-Émilion and Pomerol are the well-known and most prestigious areas in the right bank, where Merlot arguably finds itself in its most concentrated form. As we would soon find out, Saint-Émilion is the gutsier wine of the two appellations, and is supposedly less obviously from the right bank than is Pomerol. This is easy to believe with the chalky texture, high acid, dark plum, dark berry fruit in this wine, along with the oak that largely expresses itself with dark chocolate. There is no Cabernet Sauvignon in this wine (but there is 20% Cabernet Franc), perhaps accounting for the supremely lush and almost full body, but despite hot alcohol and an almost-perfect finish, the wine is quite intricate and well-adjusted. There’s a bit of added robustness from this interesting metallic earthy iron clay note in this wine which I know may put off some, but it’s sewn quite well in this wine – and its apparently indicative of the region, which brought me to guess Saint-Émilion. It’s sort of like a furry hug in a bottle, like a friendly bear that comes up to hug you, or something like an alcoholic beard prequel to Movember that isn’t a weird hipster cocktail. Bearded people aside, the wine has a cozy gruff quality to it, which isn’t surprising for a powerful vintage renowned in Bordeaux for its structure and fruit.",

I adore how Oz Clarke describes the grape as wanting to “please everybody”, such that it dolls itself up: it’s voluptuous, perfumed, and heady. At times, it reminds me of either the quirky and suave fellow or the aunt who seems to only appear at those family gatherings and you know she’s just there because you can smell the perfume from miles away. That’s the classic Alsatian expression, of course, and there exist some leaner examples which are delicious but are almost disappointing when all you want are, according to Oz Clarke, “clouds of Yves Saint Laurent’s Opium, Calvin Klein’s Obsession and Giorgio of Beverley Hills to billow out before you, announcing the arrival of the one grape no one can resist.” To top it all off, the grapes are often a dark pinkish lavender smoky-eye colour that, perhaps, you’d never guess would make white wine. Thusly you’d think that it would be so gettable, like that noxious aunt – and it often is – but it can be confused with grapes like Muscat, Viognier, and at times, Torrontes. Gewurztraminer is a grape that’s naturally quite low in acidity so it’s a bit of a giveaway like in this wine, where the low acid comes out in the pillowy texture. Low acid is tough because it often disrobes the wine to reveal any trace of residual sugar, but this wine was still noticeably dry. That being said, apparently I’m not allowed to bully Gewurztraminer in my WSET quality assessment for having flabby structure since that’s what it’s normally like. Born This Way by Lady Gaga, or something. I’m almost never in the mood for Gewurztraminer, but then again it’s almost a solution to nosing those scented lotions that are so good that you kinda wanna eat them. I hope that’s not just me.",

In other words, it’s the wine that begins the descent into the most tortuous unit of the whole shindig. The first sip has sealed the deal and I feel like I’ve sold my soul to the devil. What have I done?! Sauvignon Blanc is such a gettable grape that it almost freaks me out that it didn’t come to me on the first sniff. Simple minerals and citrus, I thought, so this must be a run-of-the-mill white bread Pinot Grigio from Italy. Luckily the two other white wines in the flight were distinct – from the baked apple and oaky glass of the second, to the soft floral lychee of the third – so when I came back to the first wine the typical greenness was a little more evident. Sauvignon Blanc was a shoe-in, and the high acid suddenly made more sense. But where from? The austerity and muted nose deflected the new world from my conclusion: if anything, France seemed to be the only logical choice given that it’s the only classic old world region that grows this grape. But New Zealand wasn’t completely out of my grasp since this I’ve been involved with such trickery before. I eventually landed a guess of some entry-level Loire Sauv Blanc, but apparently this was one from the more southerly Bordeaux, and I suppose this makes sense given the slightly heavier and creamier body. I was tired and Bordeaux didn’t even enter my mind, though I feel like I still wouldn’t have chosen it. You know I’m actually tired when I fall sleep before midnight. Apparently this wine had some oak on it – to what extent, I don’t know. I sure didn’t pick up on it, and I’m almost positive almost everyone in the room didn’t, either. It’s light and slightly unbalanced. It’s refreshing and fun, and I’ll give it that much, but I feel that if you’re going to dull the aromatic characteristics of Sauv Blanc, you might as well amp up something else. Perhaps that’s what the oak was supposed to do, but it just feels tight, shy, and repressed. The wine has the taut acidity of a violin wire but comes off as untuned. Christ – that sort of comment makes me feel like I’m Zac Posen on Project Runway. Which is basically what I’ve been watching in between studying.",

Hilarious because it’s well-known for some great and expensive examples – botrytized and blended with Sauvignon Blanc in Sauternes; identically blended but without the noble rot in White Bordeaux (or even Chile and Australia); and Hunter Valley’s long-lived Semillons on the opposite side of the scale: lean, but with similar honeyed, toasty, and tropical characteristics. It’s everything in between that’s a little one note – relatively low acidity, medium-bodied, with citrus and mineral-driven notes. It’s like the Pikachu of wines – a couple of famous examples with very few places or people; electric acidity for the best; and lasts for decades when done right. Although Australia has the reputation of having the whites and reds of throat-burning alcohol, the Hunter Valley is an intriguing area that may have the heat, but grows leaner, more acidic versions of the grape due to cloudier skies. Lower sugar content is the result. It’s hard to find Tyrrell’s in this province. You see it – you buy it. It’s that rare, and it’s delicious. Pikachu is the most well-known Pokemon, but let’s be real here – you capture it, you train it, and want to evolve it into the stronger Raichu – Pikachu is the electric superstar that sits on Ash’s shoulder. Semillon is arguably the same – my first taste of this exact same wine a year ago and I was extremely and perhaps wrongly bored with my notes consisting of a neutral, citrus and mineral-driven, slightly developed glass of acid. What’s the appeal? You’d have to wait at least a decade to find out. This time around there was more development, but just barely so – as it warmed up, there was a toasty nose reminiscent of oak, but this evidently non-oaked version had none on the palate: another idiosyncrasy of the grape. Refreshingly disjointed – heavy on the nose, but lighter on the palate. I have yet to try a Semillon at its full maturity, but this one does show balance, persistence, concentration despite lightness, and is still rather simple, but is starting to develop.",

Unlike Alsace, the rest of French wines are typically labelled by their appellation rather than the grape – so unless there’s an informative back label, the average consumer might get lost with regions that sound like they’ve come from a George R. R. Martin novel. It’s a big conversation. Alsace, for the most part, dodges this. Many (political) reasons led to this general rule, but then there’s poor little Pinot Blanc, which may very well have some Auxerrois in its blend despite the fact that it’s labelled “Pinot Blanc”. I’m sure it’s not a big deal and that it’s probably very practical for whatever reason, but it’s always bugged me since Pinot Blanc is such an underdog. I’ve never been a huge fan of Pinot Blanc, though I’ve had some notable exceptions. In this wine, I can understand the grape’s oft comparison to Chardonnay, where understated aromas meet a slightly creamy and textured (yet light) body. There’s also a bit of flintiness that joins the rather simple aromas, and the palate manages to maintain structure while displaying the equally as simple flavours. I don’t know.

I can never outright deny a glass of bubbly if ever offered, but now I can get back to drinking still wines and not feel weirdly guilty about it. Plus, it’s summer. It’s rosé time, and I don’t even care who you are right now. On the scale of rosés, Tavel is on the opposite side of the syrupy nothings that people often think that rosé is all about – I’m thinking the sweetish white Zinfandels or Baby Ducks of the world. Tavel is legitimately more interesting – because compared to other old world rosés (or most rosés for that matter), this rosé-only region is known for its structure and body, to which longer skin contact and higher grape ripeness can be attributed. And then the best can apparently age – which can be a weird paradoxical-sounding thing for rosé. It’s like you have the sunshine in the bottle, but you have to wait until it’s an uncommon resplendent orange smattering of a sunset. The wine has a beautifully intense nose that balances fruit and earth. Though the palate mirrors the fruit character, it quickly becomes overtaken by this streak of earthy minerality that finishes savoury. The relatively high acid is well-eclipsed and there is a mere suggestion of tannin. There’s a fantastic give-and-take with the fruit and earth components, especially on the palate. I feel that Tavel is a super underrated region despite its relatively well-known name – but as summer approaches, crowds of people begin to crave high quality examples from both sides of the spectrum. And I can’t help but pair this wine with a song that not only shares flavours within its title, but also embodies ideas of patience and some level of undervaluation.

Usually.).  And ironically enough, this was like sparkling white Beaujolais Nouveau and happened to get a solid 2.5 stars.

This shit goes down like pop (or, is spit out because I’m in WSET class, *ahem*) – the low acidity has carbonation for its uplifting saving grace, and the sweet impression gives a bit of a crowd-pleasing charm. This lacked in balance and length, but it had more character than a lot of boring Prosecchi I’ve gotten to know. That may as well be a horrible excuse, because a fruit bomb of a Californian Cabernet doesn’t make it any better than a more elegant wine of the same variety.

If you spend enough time with wine folks, turning your nose up at Yellow Tail is so reflexive that it’s almost an inside joke between us. But Yellow Tail is brilliant. They took a hold of their marketing reigns and went full speed, intending to do exactly what people wanted – an easy-drinking wine for the North American palate, complete with A+ marketing. As great as it is to scoff at lower quality, all wines fit into some part of the wine world, no matter how difficult in shape that the pegs are to the holes. Yellow Tail is not “bad” wine – it’s like saying McDonalds is a good representation of an all-American burger, but it’s there for a reason, and the numbers can prove it. I would call myself a bit of a wine nerd, but I’m not going to turn a glass of this down if there’s no other wine to drink. I’m not that bad. Yellow Tail is slowly in decline, but it feels like the dying voice of door-to-door evangelists – yes, I’m absolutely sure I don’t want to join you, so go away. Maybe it’s time for Yellow Tail to move on. It seems like Apothic Red is taking its place. Oh right – the wine. I’m a sucker for a white with a thicker body, but the confected and fake oak from the nose along with a flabby structure made me deem it nothing other than acceptable. If anyone like me could pick up the fake oak (by oak chips or powder, I’m guessing), it must be pretty evident, because I suck at picking up oak as it is. I’m not going to say “don’t buy this”, but I’m sure as hell going to say that there are more interesting things out there, and you should try them.",

I haven’t bought rosé in a long time, nor has the weather and time called for it (even though I twitch every time a customer shoots down the idea of drinking rosé any other time but the summer). Today I had the opening shift so I get off earlier, and it’s a beautiful day with no clouds. Therefore, I am on my patio happily enjoying this wine. It’s starting to get cold outside, but geez let me enjoy this moment with the 17 minutes that I have with this sleeveless shirt and these work-inappropriate shorts. The nose is fairly restrained. There is more mineral and a slight earthy touch to the nose, with mainly citrus and perhaps a small inkling of red fruit. A touch of spice as well. This is one of those rosés where if you had this out of a black glass, it would be tough to guess the colour. For me, at least. The nose has a distinct and specific mineral nose of rainwater – that sort of rainy humid smell just before a cloudburst. Restrained on the fruit, basically. The palate is quite the opposite. Intense and ripe flavours display themselves on the tongue and despite the small amount of residual sugar, this would still be classified as dry. A zingy acidity gently appears, and a subtle shadow of a savoury streak makes itself present. Any food that this calls for must be delicate, as this wine isn’t very strong or intense. I’m not entirely sure I get much rosé character out of this than I do white. There is a bit more body to this wine which I enjoy, and the lively palate adds lots of character without being flamboyant about it. Okay, it’s getting cold. I’m taking my glass of sunshine inside.

Pinot Blanc is the unappreciated child that everyone either ignores or is patient for. Barbara Philip MW, wine rockstar and one of the individuals in the latter category, is known around these nerdy wine hills for writing her Master of Wine dissertation on the awesome potential of this variety in British Columbia. I can’t say that I’m an exception. This is the first Pinot Blanc I’ve taken notes on. I’m such a horrible wine parent. As a result of its unpopularity, though, not a lot of people have a true grasp of this variety. A couple of blind guesses of this wine from others included Viognier, Torrontes, and Muscat. I think it’s more akin to the green to stone fruit bowl that is Ehrenfelser, but with a heavier and textured mouthfeel and higher acidity. (It’s hard to say, because Ehrenfelser is more alien to me. Drink more?) This wine is fresh, fruity, but not without a method to its madness. The creamy mouthfeel is gracefully washed away like an ocean wave continually melting a sandcastle, and a slight sassy peach pith tartness at the finish reminds me of the sun. This Pinot Blanc in particular will appeal to the (patriotic) fruit-loving wine-savvy, and I will gracefully bore customers to death about this variety just before they change their mind and leave the store. Perhaps one day Pinot Blanc and Riesling will stop spending lunch hour inside talking about minerals and playing board games and will beat up the macho Cab Sauvs and popular Chardonnays of the world.",

A relatively neutral nose exploded with bordering-on-spritzy and fresh fruit characteristics on the palate. Definitely a less serious but drinkable wine in a New World style – I almost understand why such a varietal is so popular. Couple that with a great price point and the VQA designation, and it’s a definite winner for the crowd looking for a sub-20 local Pinot Grigio. What kills me is that it’s not bad. Everything sounds like a recipe for it at least tasting like complete shit, but it doesn’t. Length is a tough parameter. Although it’s one of the measurements of quality, I can’t see the regular everyday consumer being particularly picky with it. Perhaps I’m wrong, but it’s interesting once in a while hearing that one customer enjoying a certain wine because “it went down like water” or “it left no aftertaste”. Who am I to judge?",

I would like to go ahead and apologize to this wine, who did nothing but try to please me with its bubbly goodness. But it all seemed to fall into place – the straightforward and reserved primary fruits were adjoined with a small caboose of herbaceous character (out of place?) that the instructor also picked up on, but structure seemed wobbly and length seemed shorter than I thought. And there was a bit of sweetness, but we were reminded that subtle sugar is not an all-encompassing sign of bad quality. And so I hung my head in shame. It’s that one song on the radio that you secretly like but aren’t supposed to. I will admit to having had a One Direction song on my phone. I deleted it because I got bored of it. Every time it played on my phone I would remove one earbud to make sure it wasn’t so loud such that that everyone around me could hear it – a couple of years ago, my iPod accidentally went on full volume during a Miley Cyrus song.  I didn’t look up the entire trip home on the bus and my neck hurt afterwards. I wasn’t the only one who pegged this wine as acceptable, I’m pretty sure. And it’s ironic, because I’ve heard some wine mavens question Prosecco’s popularity, while I’m usually the one silently defending it. And there I was, denouncing it in brown ink. For shame! Apparently, the grape has an intrinsic bitterness which the sugar helps to soften. Prosecco is sort of the new hip sparkling thing, and I’m pretty okay with that.",

So I’m going to just totter over to my notes and see what the definition is. … Apparently the labelling term refers to a vintage-dated tawny that has a minimum of 7 years of wood ageing, complete with a date of the bottling on the label. Cool. The wine was quite complex, with fully developed aromas: roasted nuts, caramel, raisin. But compared to the first wine (which was the 20-year-old tawny) I felt that there was more of a mushroom, leather, and almost rancio character that evolved on the palate to reveal a fleshy savouriness. And so I thought this was simply a tawny that had more age – which was peculiar – considering the deeper colour than the first. And so I was confused. The wine was yummy. I suppose the style of wine serves to exude a semi-aged tawny sort of character while displaying characteristics of a specific vintage, though it makes me wonder why grapes from this particular year weren’t either used in a tawny blend or otherwise. It’s possible that 1995 wasn’t a declared port year (I don’t know this off-hand) and therefore it was some way to get the vintage on the label. Though it’s hard to say. Colheita wines are apparently a rarity so I’ll doubt I’ll get to explore these wines from a practical standpoint.",

I was honestly in this sweet and refreshing mood (perhaps a beer mood? Brachetto/Moscato/fruit ale mood?) so it was both a bittersweet moment when I tasted this fruity and floral wine with lower acid. I instantly guessed a hot climate new world wine, although I pegged Australia on the third guess. This wine had a lot of body to it – a really weighty and thick character. I guessed a Chardonnay, which my colleague understood, but was wrong. Another analysis of the floral nose had me guessing Viognier in no time (majority of the blend) (and later I was all – “well duh, of COURSE this is Viognier, how could I be so stupid?”),  but it was the other grape took me a while to guess. I’m not amazingly familiar with Marsanne, but I think it was this grape that contributed to the interesting Chardonnay-like mouthfeel and body. The wine almost borders on flabby, but has a nice complexity on the palate and nose to sort of carry itself. Anyways, this is quite a nice blend with a decent amount of complexity. I’m a big fan of Viognier’s floral nose, and this is a beautifully aromatic wine, although there are some Viognier wines of better value out there.

So on some last Tuesday of some sort, we were supposed to have practice (I love referring to practice blind tasting sessions as such because it sounds like I’m vaguely into sports) but it was cancelled because there’s a bit of a cold going around. The viruses have decided disregard me over the past few months so I’m lucky, and that’s saying something when you’re in retail because you’re basically touching everyone. I’ll get it at the worst time, I’m sure. That one birthday when I invited my friends over but was wrapped up in a blanket the whole time. I hopped onto the 2015 Vancouver Wine Festival tickets slightly more ravenously than I did for Lady Gaga concert tickets last year, even though I’m not supremely stoked that Australia is the theme country. Don’t get me wrong – I absolutely love Australia, but part of me fears that each seminar will leave my mouth feeling stained and used. I suppose I’m doing myself a disservice by expecting exactly what everyone else is thinking, but I guess that’s why there are all the cool seminars having to do with exploring different terroirs, and weird varietals grown in Australia and other cool shit. I’m into it. According to my credit card. Led a blind tasting with my colleague at UBC the other day. Daunted by the purported amount of people attending on the Facebook event, it was bittersweet to find out that not as many people showed up (because it’s cool to say you’re going and then not go or whatever). It was fun though: we featured four wines and had flavour elements laid out everywhere throughout the art gallery, having people match up flavours to the wines. We also did this last-minute thing where we had people write collective tasting notes on this big sheet of paper (which was really just the back of an old 2014 Decanter calendar). Success, I think. Also, cool art and stuff.    INVASIVE! It’s “berry” good. The right people came to this. Also, my best friend was there <3 And somewhere on the weekend I went to a friend‘s place for dinner after work. We had rice bowls. And I enjoyed it. Because rice. And bowls. And good cooking. And meeting new people. And laughter. And pomegranates. There was both beer and wine, but I decided to go right for the wine, being the pretentious fuck that I am, and the Anselmi San Vincenzo provided just enough light for that bridge between work and, well, anything but. (Does sucking in your gut count as work?) Then there was the Brokenwood 2006 IRL Reserve Sémillon, which, hello. Pikachu: lightweight, lithe, chewing on electricity. There was the Vereinigte Hospitien 1990 “Sanctus Jacobus” Graacher Domprobst Riesling Auslese which I made people taste blindly, because I am a monster that likes to ruin the rhythm of a good evening. Like a clogged toilet.  Charcoal filter, cheese, spice, sunsets. Tasting notes, not an insane grocery list. We finished with this weird non-vintaged beauty that smelled of Christmas and applesauce. The Jean Bourdy Galant des Abbesses is a gentle beast from Jura, and it’s made from must that’s been charged with herbs and spices, then fortified with marc de Jura. Swoon. Class was decent. We had 6 wines instead of 7 because of time (we still went 15 minutes over anyways), but also thank god because tannin galore. Central Italy has some powerful and dagger-like reds, and it’s almost like they need the refreshing, neutral, and almost bland white wines to balance out the superlatives. Meh. Though the first of our whites (Fontaleoni 2013 Vernacchia di San Gimignano, $18) was a little more characterful than the blander second (Ruffino 2013 Orvieto Classico, $13), it was argued that the Vernacchia was perhaps just slightly more oxidized than it should be, but hey: it added character. The reds are where it got more interesting: we were told that we would be given four reds from the same region, and it was up to us to determine which region and what wines they were. (Tuscany, obviously.) Awkwardly enough, I thought the most expensive wine in the flight (Gianni Brunelli “Le Chiuse di Sotto” Brunello di Montalcino, $99) was the one of the least best quality: it seemed the lightest in body, but perhaps the better description is that it was the most elegant of the flight. Guessed it as a Chianti Classico that lacked a bit of concentration and complexity, but I’m often prey to the gustatory equivalents of optical illusions. I suck. The second wine (Viticcio 2010 Chianti Classico Riserva, $40) was markedly floral and dominated with Sangiovese on paper, but the expression was much more modern and dark in its fruit. Lots of dusty violet character along with plums, black cherries, and very-well integrated oak. There’s a much more viscous mouthfeel and slight shortfall of poise, an outfit which I found similar to the third red (Poliziano 2010 Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, $40), though I found flavours here much more textbook Sangiovese: sour cherry, dried red fruit, sage, and tomato leaf. I originally guessed that this one was the Brunello, but that was before I realized I had gotten the first two wines wrong. I changed my conclusion as I was reading out my tasting note, and I villainously beamed when the instructor said I nailed the wine, but I’m a Sangio-phony. Ohhhh! The last was the wine with that obvious cassis bend (Tenuta San Guido 2011 “Guidalberto” Toscana, $60), heavily suggesting something with Cab. Probably the most brooding and bearish of the four red wines, and the fullest body but perhaps tight in the slightest. Lots of opulence on the nose: spice, menthol, plum, dried black cherry, cassis, and a hint of game. My wine girlfriend is coming to visit on Monday for her birthday.

The reveal of Chile seemed so obvious, afterwards, though before landing in the northern Rhône I did venture a Touriga Nacional-based blend from Portugal, if that gives you any more idea about how punchy yet spicy and earthy this was.

Intense dark fruits and pepper on the nose yelled Syrah to me, but I missed the bits of green pepper from the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenere, which seemed to be there after the suggestion of it. There was a hint of playfulness in the background which I blasphemously noted down in hurried writing as “hint confection?”, and there was quite a bit of that raisiny dried fruit on both the nose and palate. It literally just struck me right now that the wine’s label is familiar to me because I had it with several other wines at a friend’s house a couple weeks prior. Is this the wine equivalent of getting drunk, having a one night stand, and then bumping into that same person later and not remembering their name?! I’m such a wine slut.",

Needless to say I think I nailed it but I it’s possible I replaced memories of my instructor laughing and throwing wine at me. It’s a mystery! I appreciate Sangiovese. I’m not sure I’m crazy about it, though. In its noble home in Chianti (Classico), in central Italy, it classically shows its sour red notes – think sour red cherries and cranberries – along with a typical earthy and dried herbal or floral scent. Tannins can be deceivingly on the high side, and the acidity can often be mouthwatering. These components can be really disjointed in lower quality wines, when the grapes call for such rocky qualities – even truer for Nebbiolo. This one in particular was quite unique – I picked up some petrol-reminiscent notes on the nose, which I reported was a “strong minerality”, while the instructor called it something reminiscent of clay. The nose was both classic and moderately complex, but also direct in its acid and tannin. Some age would do it well. Like!",

What’s fantastic about Chenin Blanc is that it has this piercing acidity that’s present in many of the wines it produces – so even for a sweet and full-bodied wine like this, there’s still this cleansing quality that stabs through the syrup to keep it youthful and crisp, even for a 9-year-old wine. Such a fantastic balance between the acid, sugar, and fruit, along with a lingering finish. This was revealed as $30 at 500mL and one classmate started giggling in disbelief. Quarts de Chaume is a small area within the Coteaux du Layon, which is within Anjou, which is in the Loire Valley of France. Such sweet wines in this small area are only produced in the best vintages and as a result of factors like noble rot. The suggested food pairing by the instructor was tarte tatin because of all the delicious parallels – ripe apples, mostly with kisses of ripe stone fruit and a honeyed spirit. Botrytis, the fungus that dries out the grapes and concentrates the flavour elements, gives a unique character to the wine, though it’s still a note I’m trying to get used to picking up in wines affected by its capricious presence. My only regret is that it was the last wine of the night and we only had a couple minutes to savour it before returning to real life.",

      "description": "I tasted 173 BC wines in a row which was both fun and exciting but kind of slightly vexing, like if you took Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” and replaced that phrase with “Meritage” for the entire duration of the song, and then played the song 50 times in a row. But yes – the whole ordeal was partial torture because there was a huge dominance in obvious homogeneity for heavier reds, and it becomes tough to evaluate wines when the only ones that stick out are the ones that are “different”. It’s easy to write something off as boring when it’s actually rather decent quality, so perhaps it’s safer to treat my tasting notes as a progressive story of me gently losing my mind rather than an actual set of viable records. It’s worth mentioning, though, that I highlighted some wines to retry the next day with a clearer mind and cleaner palate, because I felt like I needed to give some wines a second chance – and surprisingly enough, most of my thoughts seemed to be the same. Huge headache at the end of the 173 wines, not to mention the beer, cider, and spirits. And I know: spitters are quitters, but whatever. I couldn’t even enjoy a drink afterwards and had to gulp water until 1AM because I felt like a dehydrated piece of onion from a package of instant noodles. Favourites and stand-outs highlighted in a fun shade of blue.      Blue Mountain NV Gold Label Brut\nAll too fresh in my mind because one of their higher tiers was my last bottle of 2014. I subsequently fell asleep before midnight because I am a champion. Restrained intensity with bits of autolysis, and power.      Tantalus 2013 Riesling\nA bit more closed than I remember, but quite well-balanced. Always glad to be stabbed in the tongue by Tantalus daggers.     Thornhaven 2013 Gewurztraminer\nNot as aromatic or intense as past vintages? Maybe I’m crazy. Drier style of Gew; almost full-bodied with spice and lychee, but you already knew it would have spice and lychee because it’s Gew.     Domaine de Chaberton 2013 Reserve Bacchus\nRetried this and quite liked it: lots of that floral stone fruit, persimmon, peach candies, and a weird but forgettable hint of lipstick.              Blue Mountain 2013 Pinot Gris\nThe fruit shares the limelight with the oaky nuts. Creamy and well-balanced, like that one guy. Just kidding. Blue Mountain 2013 Pinot Blanc\nLighter than the Pinot Gris, but with good balance between stone fruit, texture, and itty bits of oak.   Domaine de Chaberton 2013 Reserve Pinot Gris\nPeaches, flowers, green apple, and there’s a bit more concentration and verve that a lot of the Pinot Gris in this flight don’t have.    Lake Breeze 2013 Pinot Blanc\nDistinctively all about the texture. Wins points for balance and texture rather than complexity. I love Lake Breeze and this is a fantastic wine, but some people masturbate to this and I kind of don’t fully get it, but then again every fourth drink I order at a bar is a Bellini so   Summerhill 2013 Small Lots Pinot Gris\nThe colour of onion skin. Applesauce, hints of starburst candy, and then a floral tea finish. Into it.   Fairview Cellars 2013 Sauvignon Blanc\nAn earthy and baked tangerine character, quite reminding me of the Sauvignon Blanc-dominated 2011 Puzelat-Bonhomme Cheverny from the Loire. I’m so France-y. You already know.  Mt. Boucherie 2011 Semillon\nStunningly only okay with its reception (???) but I thought it was an unintentional (and perhaps accidental) tribute to the style of Hunter Valley in Australia. Kind of impressed?            Poplar Grove 2011 Reserve Chardonnay\nSome complex tension on the nose. Does that make sense? Like, it’s not a basic bitchardonnay. Hints on malo on the palate and balanced. Township 7 2013 Chardonnay\nA fresh playful fruit bowl. Ahhhh!  Tantalus 2013 Chardonnay\nSuch fantastic traction between finesse and savoury character on the palate. Hints to something buttery, but it’s well contained.        Road 13 2012 Jackpot VRM\nSuperb creamy style with texture on the palate, and there’s also great tension that adds character. Quite generally well-received. Tyler Harlton 2013 By Hand White\nA bit of pear sweetness and a hint of spritz, like the first 5 seconds of a Katy Perry music video. Also quite well-received.        Quail’s Gate 2012 Pinot Noir\nLavish red fruit, strawberry; fragranced and a bit slutty.      Lake Breeze 2011 Seven Poplars Pinot Noir\nSomething pleasantly raspberry lambic-esque that’s sure to please some people. Maybe I’m just thirsty for beer.   Tantalus 2012 Pinot Noir\nRaspberry, black cherry, and hints of potpourri. A bit more melancholy and distraught for a Pinot. Quite intense tannins (for a Pinot) but much more graceful and polite than the Clone 93. Tantalus 2012 Clone 93 Pinot Noir\nSpicy, merry, and a little more extroverted than its older brother. This was more popular compared to the regular. Mt. Boucherie 2012 Family Reserve Gamay Noir\nRemember that time I made out with someone in a field of Gamay vines? I mean they weren’t Mt. Boucherie vines but I really hope that those grapes make a wine that ends up tasting something like this. Bae/10. Oak Bay Vineyards 2012 Gamay Noir\nBlooms with intensity on the palate, and very Beaujolais-like. Juicy and well-integrated, y’all. Stoneboat 2011 Pinotage\nSomething simultaneously dusty and ripe on the nose. Some kind of dried fruit, perhaps? Fruit-driven with raspberries and vanilla; appropriately intense and interesting. I like this, but I like almost all Pinotage, riot-scented or otherwise.    Time NV The Girls Red\nSpice, red fruit, and milk chocolate to match the plummy black fruit. Curvy and slightly hedonistic. Church & State 2010 Coyote Bowl Series Merlot\nA hint of agreeable greenness shows through the slowly-forming aged characteristics and ripe fruit.  Ex Nihilo 2010 Merlot\nShowing age but the wine isn’t super intense, and tannins are a tad tangled. Better as it opens up.  Painted Rock 2012 Merlot\nDeep and grapey with plums and vanilla, and a closed nose that reveals itself more on the palate. Reminds me of some modern oaked Navarra blends from Spain? Am I weird? Hester Creek 2012 Block 2 Reserve Merlot\nSmoked meat? I mean, totally bizarre for Merlot, and it wasn’t so popular with some people, but I thought it had much more balanced concentration than its barbecue sauced Cabernet Franc brother.  Poplar Grove 2010 Merlot\nSmoky fruit but restrained. Structure cockblocks the fruit – a bit tight but pleasurable.            Alderlea Vineyards 2010 Marechal Foch Clarinet\nGood balance between fruit and earth; hints of grapiness. A bit of sweetness on the palate that I’m not sure of but I suppose it’s pleasant.     Osoyoos Larose 2010 Le Grand Vin\nSpicy pasta sauce and meat. Bolognese-y and clearly showing some aged characteristics at this point but still tannic as. Church & State 2009 Quintessential\nShowing well for its age, with intensity booming on the palate. Much like the previous wine with less meat flavour. Drying finish. Clos Du Soleil 2012 Celestiale\nLushly textured and early maturing. Strong backbone.     Painted Rock 2013 Red Icon\nMalbec-dom. Oaky and soft with some drying tannins on the finish.   Poplar Grove 2009 Legacy\nA bit withdrawn on the nose but well-structured on the palate with pleasantly evolved characteristics. Like. Road 13 2011 Fifth Element\nRedcurrant, oak. A balanced hint of green pep.   Time 2011 Red Meritage\nHint BBQ, hint dried cherries, and a weird hint of church. So like, a church picnic, obviously.   Lake Breeze 2012 Meritage\nFirst vintage where Petit Verdot was used for this blend. Hint of meat and florals among the balanced soft juiciness.                Church & State 2011 Coyote Bowl Series Syrah\nBlack pepper, dried flowers, party on the palate. Delicious, and definitely more of a lightly bitchy style but in like a good way.  Moon Curser 2013 Syrah\nGrapey, juicy, lush, easy, and a little slutty. But good peppery depth. Painted Rock 2012 Syrah\nGamey, meaty, and kind of smells like my spice pantry, and more specifically, the powder in those Ichiban instant noodle things? Relatively light-footed on the palate.   Poplar Grove 2011 Syrah\nBroodingly concentrated on the nose, with a bit of restrained and flexed biceps on the finish. Good ripeness amongst the black pepper.     Elephant Island 2013 Framboise Fortified Wine\nHeady and delicious. My body is ready.  Tugwell Creek 2013 Vintage Sac\nFunky waxiness on the nose, and an interesting hint of meatiness.",

More obvious fruit, here, with crushed pears and applesauce rather than freshly sliced green fruit, along with a vivacious touch of something Bed Bath & Beyond-esque, like a soapy lemon-lime candy. It’s the Black Swan to the White Swan we tried earlier in the flight. It’s just more willing to do MDMA on Sunday night but still have its shit together to do ballet the next morning. Stylistically, this definitely has less composure than some examples of Pouilly-Fuissé, like Château Fuissé.

      "description": "Today, this wine serves a double and perhaps triple-edged purpose: it’s the Game of Thrones finale, so we need something at least slightly epic to drink; it was my brother’s birthday and he’s relatively new to wine (so we need something of an grand old-world-new-world wine); and it’s another excuse for celebrating the ephemeral end-of-wine-exams period. I’m sure I passed but I don’t think I performed in an outstanding fashion, so I should probably stop coming up with excuses to “celebrate”. Oh well! I chose the wine as something that could appeal to both my brother and I – a relatively rustic and classic old world appellation that’s both earthy yet suits the ripe palate of my brother, who at this point probably prefers the ripe Zinfandels of the world. I could tell within the first sips of the glass that it probably shouldn’t have been my first choice, as were the vintage charts and vintage reports telling me that 2011 was only at least satisfactory if not more than a solid stamp of good for the Rhône. But between the three other bottles in the running (a Priorat signed by the winemaker; a 10-year-old South African Syrah; a 2009 right bank-esque Bordeaux about which I’m being patient), I decided this was the appropriate one to open. The wine combines an intense stemmy earthiness on the nose with more than a handful of blackberries for pronounced character, and the palate is similar. But the ripe notes, especially in the mouth, are balanced by a whiff of twig-like earthiness. There is a fair bit of structure which is always nice for a warmer-climate wine, but it’s almost obvious that some of the character needs some taming. There’s also a little less of that garrigue herbal brush in any form of flavour that people often write home about with regards to Rhône wines. It’s not bad – just wonderfully two-toned: both the entry on the nose and the finish on the palate give rise to spice and earth-dominated staidness, but the ripe black fruit fills the mid-sensation, especially on the mid-palate. This reminds me of the melancholy Stark family – and in this wine, a bit of that matriarchal warmth comes from the Grenache, but in this Syrah and Mourvèdre-supporting form of Gigondas, we see a lot of a the grounded Stark-like character, including the darker sides of Catelyn. I’m surely referring to her less-than-affable nature towards Jon Snow, but there’s obviously something else. Wink. There’s also a bit of a thunderstorm going on right now which definitely mirrors the bittersweetness.",

Maybe kind of like those Campino candy things without the yogurt connotation (and maybe even worse than that), but maybe candy is on my mind because I haven’t had my fair share of Halloween treats this year. Hrmph. I suppose this comes close. I mean it’s an orange label. The palate seals the deal with a lightly-bodied wine and almost no acid to balance out the sweetness, but I suppose the saccharine fruit superficially lengthens the flavours on the back palate. $18 is a tough price point for a wine that’s merely acceptable by WSET standards, but we’re reminded that Pinot Noir is a tough grape to grow regardless of the climate. It’s “acceptable”, but it’s most definitely not unpleasant. I’ll give it that much.",

You’d think that semen from a god of wine would be something of the d’Yquem Sauternes level of things, but the vibe of Australian stickies are the pure and liquid hedonism that they bring as opposed to the complex and almost reverie-provoking elegance of top Sauternes, the latter which you usually need to patiently age, anyways. Where Sauternes can boast stone fruit, ginger, and honey, wines like these rodomontade scenes of brown sugar, dried fruit, and raisins. Okay – it doesn’t sound hedonistic in words, but you’ve really got to try it before you think otherwise. On another fluid-related note, one of my friends tried a Trockenbeerenauslese at the Vancouver Wine Festival and likened the texture to semen. I’m just going to go ahead arrest this train of thought and talk about this Muscat some more. The palate was luscious and full-bodied. The palate had a little more acid than I expected, especially for something Muscat-based. But part of the process with Rutherglen Muscats is that the grapes are allowed to dry on the vine which not only concentrates sugars but concentrates acid. And though delicious, this is one of those things I’m sure I can’t have more than a couple of mini-servings. I guess that’s another difference. There is the question, of course, to what the differences are when it comes to Australian stickies and sweet Pedro Ximénez sherries, since they can appear to be quite similar. We had a small discussion in class about it but I don’t remember what we had talked about, probably because this was too delicious and I chose not to care about anything else in the moment.",

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma class – Section 1 – Week 9] And we arrive at the wine I was most choked about not being able to analyze to the fullest due to fried smell receptors, since I’m recovering from a cold – but I did the best that I could. What a shame, because this was a terrific wine. It’s a confusion as to why I can hardly find information on this Château on both the internet and in Oz Clarke’s most recent Bordeaux compendium. Ninja Bordeaux? Of the four most known appellations of left bank Bordeaux, Saint-Estèphe is probably the hipster of the four – where Pauillac is known for its power and Margaux for its silkiness (and small Saint-Julien for his balance between the two), Saint-Estèphe finds character in what Oz Clarke describes as “an earthy scratch to the texture, no matter how refined the estate nor how well matured the wine might be”. Though the appellation can also have the reputation for being the slowest to mature, the wines tend to be of great value – like this one, I would argue, at $48. Despite the time that some Saint-Estèphe needs, we do find more instant drinkers in riper years like this one, and a discussion in class about age was brought up. One argued that this would peak in about 5 years, where there would be a nice balance between fruit and famous aged Bordeaux characteristics – but it’s hard to generalize when preferences differ. Chosen to display a blend of three grapes we studied today (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc, and I suppose Petit Verdot), this wine was impressive with a good structure, long length, and a concentrated palate, equating to being on the higher end of “very good” or the lower end of “outstanding”. Further complexity and a more harmonized alcohol would give it a higher quality, although it’s already pretty damn good to begin with. I noticed a bit of that Saint-Estephe abrasiveness but that might have been the power of suggestion. Oh – and despite my cold, I pretty much nailed all the non-flavour parameters. Insert fist pump here. For some reason I find myself fascinated with this part of Bordeaux opposed to the others, and it’s perhaps unsurprising that Tom Stevenson of The Sotheby’s Wine Encyclopedia describes Saint-Estèphe as the “least sexy of the Médoc’s famous four appellations”. Well, great. Why am I not surprised?",

It’s one of those wines that I feel is made for food, and its character with its lonesome – both in theory and in practice – comes off as boring to me, even though I wouldn’t deny a glass of this. Such a wine pairing comes alive with certain seafood (apparently… I’ve never actually tried this), but I can see a good quality fifteen-dollar wine going with a sunny day as well. Anything, really. Who are we kidding? This wine was chosen to display the fact that even AOC wines can by a bit campy and marketing-driven with their labels, especially in a region, like France, where AOC wines can be considered more traditional and subtle; that is, people don’t need the marketing, because people will automatically come to them with what people see as the regional gold standard for wines (which is an idea that is changing for this scene). And why not? The label isn’t vomit-inducing by any means, unless you have a fear of lobsters. Otherwise, the packaging is neat, eye-catching, and suggestive. I would deem this some form of a marketing success, and the wine wasn’t bad either. The was an example of a good quality wine, and strictly a good quality wine; not “acceptable”, and not “very good”. Simple, but had plenty of freshness and structure, and although lacking further complexity, it still spoke to a place. The mineral tones were evident and balanced on this guy, unlike an overwhelming stony savoury character that takes over the palate in other mineral-driven wines. The Loire guess wasn’t too hard, but Muscadet was my second guess. I sometimes find that Loire Chenin can be light and snobby in youth, hence the guess. I have no problem drinking more Loire wines to learn.",

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma class – Section 2 – Week 2] Huzzah, y’all! It looks like Champagne is going to be a common item of delicious and academic revelry for the next couple of weeks. Unfortunately, I had to read out my tasting notes for this fella. Luckily, there weren’t many corrections except for my overestimation of complexity and underestimation of length. I also underestimated quality at first, but Champagne does a thing to me. As it should. Perhaps this is a coincidental and subdued tribute to the 2014 Golden Globes, where Moët & Chandon has apparently been served for 23 years. I’m also apparently part of the minority who even remotely gives two shits about awards shows, so I’ll just stop this paragraph right here. Fuck you guys. You’re not invited to my awards party. (And if you are, the password is “Moët” but you have to pronounce it correctly.) But really: this Champagne was chosen to illustrate a wine with strong market presence and strength in volume, but still have, well, good quality, despite mass-market presence. Champagne is one of the immovable boulders in the wine world which can’t be easily shifted. The sparkling wine market is less fragmented, especially with Champagne, and comparatively few houses control a large proportion of sales worldwide. It’s a weird thing, but it’s also not so weird. It’s shitty yet understandable. I wouldn’t give a Golden Globe to this wine, but I wouldn’t kick it out of bed. It wasn’t the autolytic amazingness that some Champagnes embody, but it wasn’t entirely boring. Elegant notes of green apple and citrus were supported by almond tones, minerality, and subtle tones of biscuit. Letting the wine warm up slightly revealed notes of spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. And then for some reason I thought of Cinnabon. The wine is well-marketed and isn’t going anywhere any time soon. It’s the B-list celebrity that receives way too much attention but you for some reason don’t really question it. It’s kind of like Starbucks. I prefer other coffee, but I’ll drink it if it’s there. For me, caffeine is caffeine, kind of like Champagne is Champagne. I’m hardly picky about it, but I want the good stuff when I want the good stuff.",

Disappointingly enough, it was hard to pick up those definitive toasty notes in one of these wines and not the other. Amusingly enough, what this comparison showed was the potential for great Crémants to exist, something which is apparently not a common thing. Plenty of delicate bubbles, and there was some stinky yeastiness on the nose, along with some light red fruit notes. At face value, this is not an orgasmic wine, but compared to the Champagne, this stole the show – though it’s entirely possible that the wines chosen were simply uneven examples of what they actually are. For those who don’t know – in a nutshell, Crémants are French sparkling wines made in the traditional method but are made outside of the Champagne area – therefore, they can get those signature toasty and bready notes one would typically find in Champagne, especially when made with Chardonnay and Pinot Noir – though with Crémants, the varietals used vary according to the appellations, and Crémants can often be lacklustre. But yes – it was hard to find the difference between the two wines (perhaps the non-vintageness of the Champagne?) If you’re looking for something fun and pink and good quality, go for this. And if you’re so insistent on bread notes, bake some bread in the background, or you can pay the extra hundred dollars. Not to say that I’d deny a glass of Champagne, though.",

A second opinion by the palate confirmed that it was thin and out of balance, with a bit of residual sugar that added a juiciness and newbie-attracting character. In the world of the wine-savvy, this would be given a mere “acceptable quality”. Once again though, with wines like this, it’s not hard to see why people would enjoy it. The price is right, the region of production attracts Canadian buyers, and the palate is relatively, relatively, relatively inoffensive. Generally, though, this is thin, simple, and lacking in varietal character. It would have taken me forever to have guessed a Merlot – I’ve had a “Cabernet Sauvignon” that was lighter than this, and Cab generally has a fuller body than Merlot.

If you put this wine right after a toastnutbomb-y vintage Champagne, of course I’d get it wrong. If the previous wine was a grand orchestral number, this one is more of a string quartet. Acid is a little more austere and malic-driven (yet still not entirely high), autolytic components are not as wildly pronounced, and the wine as a whole seems a bit more comparatively more uptight and taciturn. Pair this with “Starlight” by Muse, but the Vitamin String Quartet Cover. This version is shamefully on the possible list of songs to get married to if it ever happens. Did I ever tell you about that one time I was so bored in one of my university classes that I made a wedding reception seating plan for all the people I wanted to invite? I’m so lame. At first I thought acid was lower than it was, at a mere medium level, but second sips brought me up to a medium-plus which is still on the lower side on the Champagne acidity scale. Though yummy, the contrast to the previous wine and the overall medium-toastiness led me to venture a New World traditional sparkling guess. I was obviously wrong, but it’s no wonder that it was designated as Best in Show for the Vancouver Magazine Wine Awards (vintage 2014) for superb value. The article on the wine suggests that “smart drinkers will stock up for the year.” Don’t tell me what to buy! But I’ll probably buy this. I don’t think the star on the label is completely invalid – unlike the grand moon that was the previous sparkling wine, this wine sparkles subtly more than it commands attention. And though it has a rigid Champagne backbone, the bit of roundness from the lower acidity and slightly riper fruit gives it a bit of a modern and more crowd-pleasing twist.

That means a lot for Champagne, which already sets the gold standard for orgasmic sparkling wine. So it’s kind of like saying “this Ferrari was slightly different and weird!” or “there was something about my new diamond bracelet that was sort of cool but strange!” except less douchey. This was unmistakably Champagne, if not a very well-made Old World sparkler: autolytic characteristics danced around the sword of piercing acidity while minerality drifted about the tongue, but the wine’s intrigue stems from its subtle Fino sherry-like whispers of oxidation. It’s definitely not even half the savoury brininess that Fino can be (and God forbid had I described this wine as “briny” in class, as I probably would’ve been stoned to death), but there was a marked nutty character which came from the use of oak by the producer, which allowed the wine to hang out with some oxygen molecules. The nuttiness is not so much of an intense almond or brown nut character that you might get from something like an oloroso sherry or an aged white burgundy – it’s more of an elegant and slightly salted white nut sort of melody that gives the wine a bit of a quiet whimsy. So if Albus Dumbledore were a wine, he would be this one. It’s definitely not a Champagne that turns heads due to its commanding animal-skin drum beats, but rather gets attention from some seemingly mystical otherness.",

Besides a week full of plans, today is my designated day to be lazy and drink Sauvignon Blanc. The wine is as pretty and elegant as the label but perhaps not as colourful, although it’s  both easy and tough tasting Sauvignon Blanc because it’s so gettable: as a result it’s easy to spitball every single obvious Sauvignon characteristic onto a tasting note. In this case, though, we have a classic Loire Sauvignon Blanc – perhaps as a reply to the more modern Loire Sauvignon Blancs or Sancerres of the world – with a classic fruit-restrained nose, a much more expressive palate, and a seamlessly balanced acidity on the palate. A bit linear, though. Less complex wines can often be hard to justify at high price points, especially for the shy and elegant whites of the Loire. The beauty in delicate wines like these are the balance in acidity – the wine is quite bright and round at the same time; no component dares to sing over the other, and although I hate the word “finesse” (only because I don’t think that I truly understand it), this wine seems to have it. Delicate and subtle yet strong, like carbon-fibre. Oyster wine, raw or cooked and drenched with butter, tested and true. As tough as it is to describe: the minerality and acidity in the wine play with the brine and delicate body of the oyster, creating a lasting, refreshing, and satisfying combination. That being said, Sauvignon Blanc isn’t usually a grape I find too exciting. The first few sniffs and sips are awesome, but rarely has a bottle kept me sweaty and hot throughout. New World counterparts are a bit more exciting and flamboyant, but you buy Loire Sauvignon Blanc because you want Loire Sauvignon Blanc. The grape can rarely be an adventure, which is ironic considering the pronounced scents reminiscent of the outdoors. I don’t know. Now I’m going to lie down outside, get bitten by bugs, wonder when I should catch up with paperwork, and relax to the max with this glax of Sauvignon Blanx. Baby Sancerre.",

Maybe it’s sweat. This Champagne is different than the direct and elegant ones that you often see, and is much more fuller in body and powerful, with the autolytic complexity being authoritative, yet the wine still upbeat and sprinting. I’m thinking “Pompeii” by Bastille: persuasive, kingly, and textured, with a hint of melancholy. And the walls kept tumbling down\nIn the city that we love\nGrey clouds roll over the hills\nBringing darkness from above That’s right, I just quoted lyrics from a song on my blog like a 16 year old, and you’re just going to have to deal with it while I pretend that the lyrics are about the Champagne Riots and shitty rains before grape harvest. ALSO, this song literally started playing when Naomi Campbell appeared on the screen for her new modelling show, dressed to perfection and in a fucking private jet. That’s how you know this song works, and I think we should all watch 30-second loops of her highness, drink this, and play this song over and over again. Maybe I don’t watch that show. Maybe I do. Moving on. Anyways: how this Champagne remains the (relatively) cheap price of $70 (*insert crowd groan here*) is beyond me (*insert laughter from non-Canadians here*). Further excited flips through the new edition of Tom Stevenson’s Champagne & Sparkling Wine textbook assure me that this isn’t some mistake, but rather a rare diamond in the rough of the endless bottles of what-do-I-buy expensive Champagne. I’m wondering whether or not this wine will jet up in price (or has it always been this cheap? Has it always existed in this market?), or perhaps the articles of the excited wine writers will somehow reach the public and stocks will fly off the shelves only for the tears of joy in the picture to be replaced with those of the sad variety. Bad times. There are endless Champagnes (and other traditionally-made sparklings) which inherently promise autolytic and toasty characteristics from sitting on the lees, or the dead yeast cells. Apparently the breaking down of the yeast cells (autolysis) doesn’t always happen regardless of winemakers that try to make it so, and this is perhaps why not all of the wines destined to be Champagne-esque end up tasting like broken promises. More bad times. If could ever afford a term such as “everyday Champagne”, this would be it.",

While she explained that around 65 percent of people would say it was Chardonnay, the rest would say Riesling; the class was split in that sense, but I couldn’t raise my hand for either, and did this sort of I’m-not-sure-comme-ci-comme-ça hand motion. Ironically, both grapes are arguably rather out of fashion. Chardonnay is making a slow comeback, but Riesling has a reputation of being sweet. And it’s not always sweet. It’s not always sweet. NOT ALWAYS SWEET. not always sweet. Enter this wine: I’m slightly frustrated, because Austria did enter my mind, but the biased part of me that said “no, that can’t be because why would the instructor choose Austria?” instead made me choose a dry German version, which in retrospect, makes less sense. The wine was clunkier than the elegant “lime sorbet” (as described by the instructor) versions of the Mosel. The wine was bone dry with high acid and a concentration that I thought was worthy of a very good quality designation. But I was probably overrating this wine. Flavour-wise, the wine was a steely version which was citrus and mineral-driven, with hints of developing petrol characteristics. One classmate actually guessed this as Loire Chenin Blanc, which I thought was weird, but is apparently a common mixup with wines like these. I’m sure this could age even just for a couple of years, as it has the structure and hints of classic Riesling development. It’s tough seeing people dismiss Riesling because they think its sweet, but perhaps I can convince some customers to explore areas like Australia and Austria.",

That being said, what’s in the market for whites can roughly be split into two camps: there are the more honeyed and oaked white Bordeaux where Sauvignon Blanc lays integrated within the tropical butterscotch, and then there are the modern blends dominated with Sauvignon Blanc which seem like responses to the popular gaudy styles from the new world. This wine lays deliciously in the former checkbox. The wine is most definitely oaked, but without the buttery texture of a white Burgundy – it has upfront butterscotch and toasted coconut notes, but fruit is much more tropical and honeyed, and acidity is still on the high end. Not much of the grassiness of the Sauvignon Blanc like you would get from the Loire or New Zealand, but its vivacity is still there. Though this comes from the more southerly region of Bordeaux in Pessac-Léognan, a section of Graves, most white Bordeaux comes from the Entre-Deux-Mers region (which is my kind of EDM). Some fantastic blends do some from other areas of Bordeaux, but the caveat is that they’re only allowed to be designated under the big umbrella of Bordeaux AOC, but then again if you’re a huge profitable house that only A-list celebrities can afford, maybe you deserve that.

Unlike those varietals, though, it’s not that this particular style isn’t very known – it’s just the fact that these flavours can be off-putting despite the unmistakable or familiar aroma and character. Typical nose. Compared to other Sauv Blancs from other regions, we get a nose dominated with methoxypyrazines, which I love. It’s a subjective thing, and some people hate them so much even to go as far to consider them as faults, but this wine is chock full of them and should be. This character is reminiscent of that wacky yet loveable kid in class that the teacher always hates on for no reason. The nose is almost salsa-like. Vegetal and then citrus aromas are present, and I can’t help but think of tacos. I think you should pair this (and Chilean Sauv Blancs) with Mexican food. I do love the nose, but the wine lacks a bit of acidity and a maybe a little more fruit. Otherwise, it’s a nice introductory wine for something out of the ordinary.

Purer red fruit, for example, in Barbera d’Asti, and a bit spicier and darker in Barbera d’Alba, sort of like how you can get estery Gamay from Beaujolais Nouveau over to the earthier and grittier cru Beaujolais like this one. And suddenly my Sansa Stark = Cru Beaujolais and Arya Stark = Barbera d’Alba analogy sort of makes more sense. This wasn’t as complex as a Sansa Stark though. Spicy red fruits, yes, and a nice glowing acidity, but mostly fresh, and just fresh – and sometimes it’s hard to be a fresh red. Thats the selling point of this one. The three reds in this flight were chosen to display different textures of tannin: in this wine, the tannins weren’t exactly high by any means but were a bit coarse and astringent despite being sparse. We would then contrast this to the second wine, a 12-year-old Rioja Reserva, which had present yet chalky tannins, and then the third was a Syrah-based blend from Chile, which was intense and tannic – but was soft all at the same time. I guessed this as Barbera, as did the classmate who was reading out his notes, probably due to the high acid and the hint of earthy scratch on the palate. Maybe not my favourite Cru Beaujolais, but the underdog region endlessly fascinates me and this is the first time I’ve consciously tried one from Régnié (though I remember bringing one to a wine tasting, perhaps), which has been the newest Cru of the region since 1988, rounding out the number of Cru Beaujolais up to 10. Which just sort of feels right. I mean, 9 is a great square number (and I love me a good square number), but there’s just something about referring to the 10 Cru Beaujolais as the 10 Cru Beaujolais which feels a little more royal, and the region just needs a bit more royal in it.",

Bordeaux class, so Sauternes, unquestionably. Yeah, gurl. How often do you get to try one of the most prized dessert wines of the world? I’m not bragging, because all we get is a wee dram enough for tasting, and God knows I’m poor as fuck from WSET diploma tuition, anyways. This is as close as it gets, except for that time I knocked over my boss’s glass of Château d’Yquem. It shattered all over the floor and in perceived slow motion, I’m sure. Sauternes is a dessert wine from the southern part of Bordeaux; Barsac is something of a subregion of Sauternes, and both are located near other dessert wine appellations: Cérons and Loupiac come to mind, though the actual region of Sauternes is where these dessert wines achieve the best quality. The region, due to the conjoining rivers which surround it, achieves some form of morning mist which encourages Botrytis cinerea to thrive on the grapes, and the fungus develops into the form of noble rot rather than grey rot as the afternoon sun dries the grapes out. What blossoms, as a result, are grapes concentrated with sugars, flavours, and acids, along with a distinct and interesting honeyed Botrytis character – one that I’m still working on describing. There’s something so supernatural and magnificent about harnessing rot, out of all things, to create one of the world’s most expensive and natural drinks. What sets Sauternes apart from other sweet wines in a blind tasting is the liberal usage of oak, which imparts a distinct vanilla scent. This wine is mainly perfumed with stone fruits, with honeyed peach, ripe apricot, and ripe nectarines covered with vanilla cream, along with baking spice, hints of earthy mushroom, and a bit of Botrytis funk. The palate is lusciously full-bodied and mouth-coating, carrying the same flavours on the palate with more intensity. Amazing concentration, length, and complexity – though being so full-bodied and succulent, the wine does lack some freshness and acidity on the palate. That to me says this is peaking, but for such a wine, the peaking window is still so large. Even as a first growth this is a great price. Sweet wines are at a trough in the graph of popularity, and it’s such a shame.",

I feel like I’m noticing a pattern with this particular instructor on the first day of classes – opening with Champagne, and ending with a dessert wine. Perfect. I find it hard to rate dessert wines. As evolutionary organisms, we are inclined to love sweet things because they contain carbohydrates. Although that last sentence can be easily given a nod, it can just as easily receive a furrowed brow when you try a sweet wine that is cloying, or having no acidity to balance it out, and you have an unclean sweetness not unlike the sensation of drinking maple syrup. This was an example of a wine with that viscosity yet had that nice cleansing acidity. And even though I and my colleagues found it just a tad less concentrated than other examples we’ve had in the past, we all agreed that this was an absolute steal for $60. A full 750mL bottle of 12 year old Sauternes?! Yes, please. I would easily buy this again.",

On a rainy morning dodging puddles and people, Christine, Amy, Leeanne, Sujinder and I bussed up to Elmira from NYC. This of course involved a cryptic and boisterous man who sat behind our group and modified the intensity of his New York accent depending on who he was talking to on the phone, including Joey, which included a mild conversation about picking up sodas at the dollar store; and then Beryl, to whom he aggressively told to check her mailbox and to “not worry about it” (severed hand?!). Obviously the world knew our NYC experience wasn’t over yet, and we’ve accomplished a lot before anything officially #WBC15. Anyways, we then rented a car straight up to Hammondsport, not before visiting Forge Cellars at the Hector Wine Company. So it began: this was our first flight of wines in the sub-AVA of Seneca Lake in the Finger Lakes AVA! Though my mind was excited like a child (or me) on his way to the ice cream store, I was physically exhausted and maybe fell asleep in the car in only minute-long intervals in fear that I would inadvertently create the best picture of our travels. Pictured: Sujinder judging me We tasted through the wines of Hector Wine Company along with wines of Forge Cellars, which is essentially a collaboration between Rick Rainey; Justin Boyette, winemaker at Hector; and Louis Barruol, vigneron of Chateau Saint Combe in Gigondas, located in the Rhône Valley of France. And so we arrived and legs were stretched. Hurrah. Justin Boyette Hector 2014 Pinot Gris, $18\nGreat: my first tasting note of a New York wine and I have to decipher this particular hieroglyphic tasting note. Aged in neutral French oak. A handful of white flowers and honey; savoury with a hint of herbaceousness (and a hint of something I can’t read). Soft and medium-bodied. Hector 2014 Sauvignon Blanc, $18\nA bit of nettle underlying satsuma, passionfruit, and guava. More of a supple tropical bend rather than herbaceous and high-pitched; overcast instead of sunny. Hector 2013 Dry Riesling, $18\nSteely and restrained nose, with lemons, honey, and peaches. Dry and not as jagged on the palate as I expected, with soothing moderate intensity. Forge 2013 “Classique” Riesling, $24?\nLarge proportion fermented and aged in barrels of varying ages. Something cracker or yeast-like which I’ve noticed in few other Rieslings. Elegant limeade with something meaty or defiant. Focused lime zest on the palate with a pleasant bitter-acid fruit finish, like a margarita without any sugar. Forge 2013 “Les Alliés” Riesling, $26\nFermented and aged in neutral barrels. Stands up straighter than the Classique. Dry; petrol, citrus, and a hint of cooked grapefruit. A bit of oxidized tangerine on the palate with zesty acidity. Hector 2014 Riesling Semi-Dry, $16\nFresh sweeter stone fruit on the nose; off-dry sheen on the palate with flighty and almost effervescent peach and pit with cleansing acidity. Juicy and chuggable. Hector 2013 Gewurztraminer, $20\nA ringing burst of spice, apricots, and dried flowers. A hint of sweetness emerges like a Diglett poking its head out from the ground, and this grades into a blanket of savouriness and an impressive amount of acid for the grape. Long and rosy. Forge 2013 Rosé\nPinot Noir. Pale pink. Floral strawberries and cream. Humble rather than arrogant on the palate, with a play between fruit and earth. Concentrated. Closer to the side of round rather than refreshing. Forge 2013 “Les Alliés” Pinot Noir\nVery pale ruby. Huge fan of the aromatic nose, but maybe I’m just a huge fan of smoke, game, and meat. Time will disentangle the palate’s rigidity. This one split our group in half, and everyone knows I love when that happens. Hector 2013 Essence, $25\nEqual parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot. Also equal parts American, French, and Hungarian oak. Slightly charred plums and chocolate; medium-bodied and silky with sparkles of ripeness. Fair amount of chalky structure to contain the fruit. Well-made but not as individualistic as the whites; muscular with a silky man bun. We left satisfied, but it was clearly time to deflate for a bit into our motel rooms. Though we snacked on two salads, evening sustenance was a 2 minute walk away at The Village Tavern. I missed vegetables and even though I eat meat, I ordered the menu item named “Vegan Adventure” though clearly the name was the most obvious red flag: it was basically stir fry, thin rice noodles saltier than the tears of a thousand mermaids, and a random hedged-bet garnish of pickled ginger and wasabi. Oh: is this the general “asian food” that every wine critic promises will pair divinely with every Gewürztraminer? When in Rome, Josh. When in Rome! #burgerregret But really: everyone else’s food was apparently amazing – and probably no one orders the Vegan Adventure to the point where they probably had to run outside immediately after my order to go and pick the carrots out of the ground – but otherwise, the wine list was absolutely divine, with no shortage of interesting varieties and back vintages of New York wines and otherwise. I almost chose a New York Rkatsiteli from my birth year (1992) for the table but decided that it might not be refreshing enough for our temporarily ragged souls. I regret it. In lieu of dessert, we borrowed a knife from the restaurant so that Leeann could teach Amy and Christine how to saber the bottles of sparkle we picked up on the way; we then we enjoyed those plus the same funky Prosecco from a previous night and a Crémant de Bourgogne around the fire pit next to our living quarters, whose owner (Don? Ron? Shawn? Fawn?) joined us as we had conversations about the film ratings of our lives. I say that I’m PG, but I mean this whole trip is changing everything, no? Regardless, this amazing evening full of vibes and connections is an ending to an episode with credits rolling and Wonderwall playing in the background. And the music abruptly stops as it cuts to a scene of next morning, where everyone is swimming in the lake or going for a jog or something and I obviously tangle up in sheets instead.  Clos des Vignes du Maynes “Ste Geneviève” Crémant de Bourgogne Extra Brut (Burgundy, France)\nNutty green apple, cider, and apple pie on the nose, with some precise acidity and doughy toast on the palate.

Anyways, I love to delve really far into a region (book-wise only unfortunately), and revisit my tasting notes. Most of the time, I think “WOAH, I had the opportunity to taste THAT?” and get angry that my knowledge was more limited back then (despite the fact that it was only last June), and sometimes I doubt what I had rated these wines, since after reading about them, I have a greater appreciation of what they’re supposed to be like. Who knows, perhaps I’ll get rid of this star system or change it some time in the future. It’s really cool, having a greater understanding of what you tasted 9 months ago. I noted the fresh acidity of this wine, as well as its rather neutral characteristics. One of the biggest things I had and have a hard time being aware of is elegance and finesse. I can understand how this wine could bore some – this isn’t a very aromatic wine. But this wine excels in terms of its elegance, and it’s really cool once you can appreciate that. Neutral italian whites like these can be found at all price points, with varying quality levels. I need to not be afraid (as well as consumers) of exploring other Italian whites of lower price points: Vermentino, Verdicchio, and the like.",

I still need time to dedicate the thick pages to memory, but I thought I’d hold a mini-celebration and open a bottle of Bordeaux, anyways. It’s just an excuse to drink, really. Tomorrow I’m sure I’ll find a dirty quarter on the ground, and it’ll be an excuse to open a beer. I bought this guy months and months ago while needlessly going on a wine shopping spree at some other store. It was the last bottle they had of it (I’m always a sucker for things like that), and it was somehow mentioned in Drops of God, which is a wine-themed manga I have yet to read. I’ve had this particular wine described to me as “liquid clay”, and I imagined this really cool fluid earthiness that would smell like crushed Gastown bricks on fresh Commercial Drive garden soil, coming together to make some sort of bottled East Van (though Parallel 49 has pretty much covered that in visual form) – the wine obviously has more fruit than I skeptically imagined. The back of the bottle claims that the wine was bottled on a waning moon. Part of me wants to not care, but I really do, and I’m not sure if I should hate myself in some way for falling for that kind of marketing. It’s kinda romantic. The wine is a little light than I expected for an opulent year, or perhaps my expectations were simply in the wrong ballpark. But if I were to compare it to a wine I’ve had recently, it slightly resembles an aged Pomerol. The colour is starting to develop from the five years of age; the body is medium at most, and perhaps slightly below that. It’s also showing hints of development, with bits of leather showing against the mostly baked and dried plum-driven fruit. Subtle oak, though the back claims two years. I really like the intensity, here, and structure is also rather subtle. It’s definitely an early-maturing style: can’t develop a better kingdom if you don’t have the walls, so cash it in. Not sure what the blend is, but it’s most certainly Merlot-dominated, and the wine is produced from organically-grown grapes. Bottled on a waning moon, though.",

I know some people who hate methoxypyrazines so much that they almost think it’s a flaw and needlessly evangelize so to new wine drinkers (cue FNH 330 prof, here), but it’s an interesting aroma to appreciate.  As said, there was a little bit more of that vegetal character and a little bit less of that floral aspect, but it was still noticeably our good old friend Sauv Blanc – the queen of the grassy; the mother of the Cab Sauv. This wine for 14 bones was awesome. If you like your New World wines but want something a bit mellower, this is a great example of how a Chilean wine can suit that need.

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma class – Section 2 – Week 1] I honestly do not remember the last time I’ve formally tried a Madeira. It must have been maybe back in the WSET Advanced days, which was literally over a year ago. I’m only perpetuating the idea that Madeira is the biggest underdog of the wine world to the point of worry, where wine authorities wonder about its slow demise or pessimistically hope for its return in a world full of so many other things. Maybe I dreamed that it was so dramatic. But it’s for poor ol’ Madeira, so I’ll take it. Madeira is known for being quite unique and “indestructible” in a sense that it’s intentionally heated and oxidized. As a result, it can have a similar oxidized nuttiness like Sherry does. Unlike Sherry, though, Madeira has much more acid on the palate, which is something that I should have taken into consideration during the blind flight. Learning curve. The nose had distinct oxidized notes of almonds, cola, and soy. It’s a weird combination that blends together well, and there’s an interesting hint of dried citrus along with some spice and leather. As if Madeira and Sherry weren’t already sort of similar, there are subsections of each which will make it even more difficult during blind flights, but then I wonder if anyone who’s allergic to nuts gets a mini-heart attack every time they smell a Sherry or Madeira. This particular Madeira is made from Tinta Negra Mole, which sort of acts like a mimic to the “noble” Madeira varieties, named: Sercial, Verdelho, Bual, and Malmsey. It’s sort of like the pawn that reaches the end of the chess board. Because it’s still damn good. This marks the first Madeira tasting of this unit. Huzzah!

I think it might have to do with the clouds and rain, which are normally quite nice, but something’s blocking my brain and I feel like I have to obligatorily blame it on the weather. Maybe I need to watch a movie, or go on a mini vacation, or just hug someone for a really long time. It sure is an excuse to get juices flowing with actual alcoholic juice, but I’m going to not because my brain is telling me no. (Which means it’s going to be one can of beer or just a hint of scotch. And then maybe more scotch.) wow can u not Two weeks ago, I skipped class on southern Italy to attend an afternoon whisky seminar followed by a sobering nap. And then downtown for a good friend’s birthday. Would’ve been great had I not had to work early the next day, but I guess these things make you feel alive, even if “alive” means “searing headache”. Last week, I skipped a workshop class in order to study, sip on some Franciacorta, and hang out with some cool people. I was really tempted to skip this week for no good reason, but I went. And I know: rain and tiredness is no real reason not to trudge all the way to class, and yes – insert Nike commercial here or whatever – but let’s not forget that I’m still a pretty terrible human being. The class was business-based and we tasted two flights of four, plus an in-class analysis activity in partners. FUN! Really. “If you can’t handle me at my Apothic, then you sure as hell don’t deserve me at my Insignia.”   The topic my partner and I had was “California Red Blends”. Just the best, sweetest, and most delicious topic. Duh. There were no hints to our flights of wine, but it became a bit evident that we were tasting wines whose regions we won’t cover in class. Spread the love, you know? Spread it all over our mouths. The flight of whites wasn’t super difficult but it had its tricks. Spritz and freshness gave the first wine away (Casal Garcia Vinho Verde, $12), while the third, the lime-dominated obvi-Riesling, had most people split between one from the Eden/Clare Valley in Australia, a drier German Riesling (i.e. Rheingau), Alsace, or Austria. To me, it wasn’t piercing enough for the first option, and not peachy and elegant enough for the next two options, and the limey more savage version brought me to Austria (Weingut Bründlmayer 2008 “Kamptaler Terrassen” Riesling, $30). Could’ve been a flukey guess. The fourth (Michel Torino 2013 “Cuma” Torrontés, $14) was easy-ish: Torrontés is part of the aromatic group of grapes that smell like Bed Bath and Beyond decided to collaborate with the tropical section of that asian grocery store, but with more acid and generally a lighter body than grapes like Viognier and Muscat. Into it. The second wine (Domäne Wachau 2012 Grüner Veltliner, $18) was the hardest of them all and had me running around in circles and I landed a bunch of incorrect guesses like a white Côtes-du-Rhone, South African Chenin, and holy water. Ugh, Grüner, whatever. Same diff. Though the flight of reds was harder, I don’t know how I mostly nailed the fifth (MOB 2011 Dão, $45) and sixth (Quinta Vale D. Maria 2011 Douro, $55) Portuguese wines besides the semi-hint. Spidey senses. I think the point here was that the Dão was slightly fresher than the fuller Douro field blend, though the core personalities of both were rather twin-like. But more fraternal than identical. The seventh wine (Cono Sur 2012 “Block 21 Viento Mar” Pinot Noir, $20) was a bizarre and clunky combination of dried oranges, pomegranates, and wine gums and I wasn’t super into it; the last wine (Ridge 2011 “Lytton Springs”, $55) was fun, I suppose. It was close enough to the Portuguese wines that it had me suspicious, but it was different enough that I had to raise an eyebrow and squeeze out a half-guess before calling it a day. And then I went home and said I wouldn’t have a drink because of the next day’s shindig, but I had just the smallest pinch of scotch. So yes: the next night included lots of alcohol and laughter and fun with awesome colleagues, plus this bottle of Château Coulac 1983 Saint-Croix-du-Monte. The appellation is across the river from Sauternes, and that’s all I really know. Apparently a fantastic year for the region, and though there’s a real honeyed character, there’s a dry and almost steely nuttiness that illuminates the amphitheatre that is your mouth. Definitely drier than we were expecting, I think? (I was going to make a “You Sauternes me on” joke, but it’s the wrong appellation and now I’m sad about it.)  And then we all ran out of wine, so we had beers and whisky instead. Drunk salad is now a thing that happens at home before I go to bed. It’s true. There’s a fun wine dinner happening on Sunday and I’m stoked and not stoked all at the same time. Casal Garcia Vinho Verde – WSET Tasting Note: Ridge 2011 “Lytton Springs” – WSET Tasting Note:",

Oy. I still stand behind the fact that it’s not horror-scream-bad, but clunky enough to elicit a raised eyebrow and overturned wine glass. I was simultaneously surprised and not surprised at the reveal. It’s the Facebook equivalent of looking at your year-old status updates and realizing how dumb you were. Sort of. Originally I thought this was Prosecco (along with the classmate who read his notes out loud, and I’m sure others thought so as well) because of more playful fruit. Too playful, in this case, to the point of being almost off-dry. I’m being nice, because some classmates said it was soapy, unnecessarily earthy, and flat. Gummy, cheap, and it’ll do the trick – but I’d stretch to something with a bit more acid or depth.",

Initially the really ripe fruits had me guessing a New World Chardonnay from a hot area (unfortunately I didn’t pick up on the acidity), but lo and behold, this was an entry-level Burgundian Chardonnay that borders on that New World ripeness. Although this is a good entry-level Chardonnay on the lower end of the mid-price range, I feel like I wouldn’t go back to it because there are either wines with a bit more complexity for the same price point or cheaper wines with just-as-ripe fruit. That being said, it’s simple, worth a try, and I can see this being a good-priced crowd-pleaser. For 21 bones, this essentially does what it’s supposed to, especially if it’s from Burgundy. EDIT: Retried this in August, and it’s surprisingly way different from what I remember. I remember thinking this was so fruity and enough so to think it was from somewhere like Australia, but that could have been attributed to the fact that the comparison to the other wine we tried was vastly different. This time around, I didn’t get as much fruit and noticed the buttery Chardonnay-like characteristics – but I guess that’s what happens when you know what you’re tasting.

It was pathetically amazing. So there. Moscato d’Asti is such a crowd pleaser. A typical one will be sweet but light, along with beautiful fruity and floral notes. I recall aromas of lychee, green apples, notes of stone fruit, and oranges. It had a medium sweetness with a perfect balance of acidity to clean off the palate. I thought that it would be great to bring back for a Valentine’s Day-themed wine tasting session at UBC – out of a rosé, a Cava, and an Amontillado, this Moscato d’Asti was the traditional and more subtle personality of the wines, with Cava being the adventurous, the Amontillado being the strategic, and the rosé being the hopeless romantic. I only know of one person who didn’t really enjoy this wine – which I respect, but then again, among his favourite wines are White Zinfandels (oh God, I’m “that guy”, aren’t I?). I made a Justin Bieber White Zinfandel joke one time for a tasting I led at UBC, and people actually laughed, which made me feel all cool and stuff. Although a good choice for your friends that “don’t really like wine”, it’s sort of a shame that Moscato d’Asti can perhaps be a little expensive or perhaps lacking in variety at times, but perhaps this is only true in BC. I’m starting to see similar wines that are less expensive (and perhaps less complex) pop up, and although Moscato (d’Asti) may be seen as a less serious quaffing-type summer wine, it’s good to see some variety. It’s the one type of wine many of the executives and I at the UBC’s wine tasting club agree to keep bringing back, because everyone seems to like it.

That being said, I can think of a couple of other Bordeaux wines for this price point that are slightly higher in quality; I can also think of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines from South America that are also much more concentrated.

I find that Loire Cab Franc (at the same price point) tends to be earthier, funkier, and sometimes more angular than its more expensive Pinot Noir nemesis, and I feel like some Pinot Noir enthusiasts can be converted to the similarly-bodied grape – if only it weren’t for oft-difficult price points and the lack of attention. The New World produces fuller, darker versions, still with a characteristic green note. But yes – the funk. Despite my fried smell detectors, there was an obvious brettanomyces funk on the nose, which isn’t strange for the Loire, but is somewhat intriguing for an acidic wine, where brett thrives in higher pH (i.e. less acidic). And the acid is well-integrated, but the tannins, despite only being at the medium level, are quite mean and green, which can put off new drinkers – and is probably another reason why not all Pinot lovers can be converts. If only. I get excited for hipster grapes. The refreshing lack of oak here is great for a lighter red (compared to the two main partners of a Bordeaux blend), which Cabernet Franc can be without the smouldering silkiness of a Pinot.

I enjoy the full-bodied oily texture, but on the mid and back-palate, it starts off as a generous overripeness (with floral flavours) that fades into a savoury stony character.

This wine is a bottle of sass. So much sass. The sweetness is what we deemed between dry and off-dry. Definitely some residual sugar, but definitely has the acid to prevent cloy.

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 8: Burgundy] The first time I’ve had a Premier Cru Burgundy was in WSET Intermediate class years ago – it was the Latour-Giraud 2008 Meursault-Perrières. Looking at my notebook, I don’t seem to have much to say about it. I mean, good for you if you’re bedazzled by young and amazing white Burgundy at age 19, but I guess I needed more convincing. The second time I’ve ever had a Premier Cru Burgundy was in WSET Advanced class, where it looks like I was really unimpressed. Just earlier this year I realized how amazing it was that I tried a Meursault and I back-pedalled hard, but retrying this helps me understand my past self. I mean, you hear about how textured and hedonistic and buttery Meursault can be, but it takes such a long time to get there. I suppose I just taste a lot of them way too young. Still quiet on the nose, though, with developing notes of green fruit, butter, nuts, and something minerally but strangely pleasant, like a hint of petroleum. It’s fascinating to experience the pronounced flavours on the palate, yet they’re so bizarrely restrained and coy at the same time, and it’s hard to describe exactly what the flavours are. There’s an interesting fleshy and buttery green apple, and a savoury character that lasts on the palate.",

Such delicious aromas on the nose and flavours on the palate. Although we picked out some individual notes on the nose like raisins and an oxidized soy quality, I couldn’t help but go back to the whole bakery thing since it seemed like all the oxidized, yeasty, and nutty notes added up to that. I would most definitely buy this again, and this would make for such a nice autumn or winter gift/share. It’s times like these where I’m glad not many of my friends like wine, because I can sip on this shit all night even though I’ll look like a pretentious grandma while everyone else does tequila shots. This is quite delicate for an Oloroso according to our instructor. I think the price point is well-justified, and I’m definitely keeping my eyes peeled for this fellow. It’s quite unfortunate that Sherry is relatively unpopular in the BC market. This is great stuff.",

      "description": "After much debate at the liquor store – which also made it probably look like I was suspicious – I finally came to the conclusion that this was a day I where the whole “should-I-spend-x-less-dollars-for-this-wine?” and “should-I-experiment-with-shitty-weird-grape-varieties?” cards were cards that deserved to be torn up and burnt, and so I knew that I had to beeline to exactly what I was craving. Plus I’m kind of annoyed and I want to douse my soul in good wine. I also didn’t drink anything yesterday, so that’s another excuse. I want pure fruit framed with some sort of structure, and Alsace is usually good for providing that. Being the sunniest area of France, it’s no surprise that grapes ripen easily but retain acidity from being in such a northern climate. Fruity but not flabby, flashy without being slutty, etc. I open the bottle and it’s not 100% what I’m expecting – the nose has a med+ intensity, but the fruit seems either faded or tight. It’s hard to tell from a grape that’s supposed to be drunk as soon as possible (i.e. within two years of the vintage for dry Alsatian Muscat) but is listed on the producer’s website to be enjoyed from 2012-2022. It’s dry but not oily like Gewurztraminer (a grape that its often compared to and sometimes confused with in blind tastings) and instead has a strong runway of savouriness that carries on to the finish. Seems to be an intended style according to the winery’s tasting notes. They’re right – it surely does finish more like a Riesling rather than Muscat, but I’m surprised considering the other Muscat I’ve had from them. According to the website – it seems like the wine from this particular area is done in a more elegant and spritzy style. That being said, drink this at room temperature (as I’m doing now) if you want to emphasize varietal character. I’m enjoying it much more in this state. It seems irritatingly uptight for a higher-priced Muscat and lacks the heady grapey quality that brings the grape to fame. Maybe it’s too old. Maybe it’s corked and I don’t know it. All I know is that I wasn’t transported to a field of ripe peaches, flowers, and unicorns when I stuck my nose into the glass. Like, it’s maybe Glinda the Good Witch territory, but definitely not anything past that. It’s good, but perhaps too stony and elegant for my deflated mood. You wouldn’t choose salad for a Netflix night in your underwear. Maybe I’m too dumb and don’t know anything – that’s always a possibility. Regardless, bottom’s up.",

Especially when the oak isn’t overdone, a wine like this definitely deserves comfort wine status, and can be comparable to the plushness of a Merlot without the tannins.

This wine was somewhere in the middle of the spectrum and served to show that there are some good things that exist in this world – and in this case, a fortified wine that isn’t shitty but also doesn’t make the wallet cry. Sort of like the bucket of supermarket-brand ice cream which is cheap and delicious but mostly just for the first couple of scoops: I suppose that makes this a wine that you drink while watching rom coms after a break-up. In addition, it’s easy for the wine geeks to turn their noses up at wines with borrowed terms of designation, especially due to the horror stories of Californian “Burgundy” or Californian “Chablis” that come to mind (or “gluten-free” or “scent-free” or “porn”) – but this wine was selected to be shown in class to show that sometimes there can be some quality in that respect.

      "description": "It’s clear that we’ve taken a departure from the experimental seminars of 2015’s Australia to the tacit themes of longevity and traditionalism of 2016’s theme of Italy for the Vancouver International Wine Festival. It’s expected that the colossal tasting room is skewed towards the stars of Tuscany, Piedmont, and Veneto, so this leaves the underdogs few and far between. There is not one Dolcetto (yeah I know: who cares) nor one pearl-clutching Franciacorta being poured during the whole festival, nor are there enough Montepulciano for me to make a terrible d’Ab(ruzzo) joke, so last year’s boner for Australian Touriga Nacional would have to be partially satiated by a seminar on all things white and distinctively not Pinot Grigio. I often find the whites of Italy frustratingly subtle – which probably says more about my taste above anything else – but this’ll be a nice opportunity to break things down past this pigeonhole. Vampire Weekend’s “Unbelievers” is the chosen song for the pre-seminar slideshow. Good sign?  Leader for the seminar is Ian d’Agata, the supremely encyclopaedic author of the substantial “Native Wine Grapes of Italy” tome; scientific director of Vinitaly International Academy; writer for Vinous and Decanter; and owner of a laugh worthy of being a ringtone (I’m sure ian_laugh_5b.mp3 is floating somewhere). Other moderators for this session include Michaela Morris and Gurvinder Bhatia. (And yes: I know that Pinot Grigio isn’t technically an Italian grape. Sit down.) We started with the Mionetto Valdobbiadene Superiore di Cartizze Prosecco Dry ($40), rather pricey because these particular Glera grapes are grown on the hill of Cartizze, allowing longer hanging time, and therefore sweeter-tasting fruit without an adverse drop in acid. The land is so coveted and legit that it’s currently more expensive than that of Barolo or Montalcino (!). Ian discusses, that within Italy’s tangled system of appellations, the distinction between Prosecco’s higher tiers of the Conegliano and Valdobbiadene regions is one of the few that make sense: the former is often a bit fruitier and pleasantly balanced with some bitter notes, while the latter is often more floral and subtle. The Glera signature, though, is that of white peach: this is well-contained amongst the chalkiness and white flowers here, as well as a pinch of something a bit green and herbaceous. The palate yields a Prosecco that feels creamier and fuller than most, complete with a refreshing floral ending. I think it’s slightly Alanis-Morisette-ironic that I’m resenting these bright lights because of one too many Bellinis consumed 12 hours prior, but I guess that’s what you get for getting wasted on a Tuesday evening. #fullcircle Vespaiola is one of those odd random grapes that one has to remember for wine exams. It essentially belongs to the relatively obscure Breganze DOC in Veneto, but its on-paper personality seems unapologetically dull: Vespaiola’s signature is its naturally high tartaric acid and its elevated level of terpenes, contributing to lightly floral and herbaceous tones. But it reaches its pinnacle when made into a sweet wine, which is where its cleansing brightness comes in handy. The Beato Bartolomeo Breganze 2014 “Sulla Rotta del Bacalà” Vespaiolo ($29) was expectedly on the neutral side, but was subtly perfumed with green fruit and dried white flowers; acidity was high but not so piercing, ending with potpourri. Bonus fact: the name of the grape comes from the word “wasp” in Italian. not this kind Ribolla Gialla, according to Ian, is a “victim of its own versatility”, which I suppose means that the vigorous grape is being treated this way and that, sparkling or with extended maceration – or perhaps both? – instead of letting its real personality shine. Every coming-of-age teen movie ever? Ian says that the Attems 2014 Ribolla Gialla IGT ($20) from Venezia Giulia is quite archetypal for the heat-loving grape, with heavily perfumed white flowers, citrus zest, and lots of white pepper. The ethereality is concentrated on the palate with a round and saline ending, less so like every coming-of-age teen movie ever, I think. Still haven’t watched the Breakfast Club. It’s not about toast, right??? k this was a dumb joke but i don’t care and i’m laughing I’ve never really been a fan of Arneis which makes me feel bad because so much work has been done just to get it out of near-extinction. Vietti is often credited as the main hero: their Vietti 2013 Roero Arneis DOCG ($40) is gently floral with some pear fruit and a bit of peachy flavour; the signature bit of herbaceous hoppy character reminiscent of some French rosé is here as well, and the body is creamy with a bit of a cheeky tactile edge that I swear might be a whisper of tannin. The grape was historically a martyr for Nebbiolo, a grape whose juice Arneis once used to soften under the “Nebbiolo Bianco” synonym, and a grape that was grown for the purpose of being eaten by birds in the vineyard so that Nebbiolo would be untouched. I’m seeing some Skyler White parallels here but I won’t open that bottle.  I’ve always been a fan of Soave and its main constituent, Garganega, because of the elegant creaminess and nuttiness the wines can often exude at their best. The Tedeschi 2014 “Capitel Tenda” Soave Classico DOC ($30) is quite heady and musky; maybe something a bit medicinal. On the palate, there’s something a bit like caramel apple? Maybe marzipan, or bits of nougat? The body is on the fuller side but but with a bright middle and a creamy peach undertone that ends in citrus zest. The wines that the grape can produce are apparently ageworthy, as long as Treb’s vigorous yields are kept in check: a flaw that too often results in dull and watery wine. “jesus did you really turn my water into wine i don’t believe you” “ya it’s just bad soave lol” Enter the Zenato Azienda Vitivinicola 2013 “Sergio Zenato” Lugana Riserva DOC ($44): first I was pretty sure “Lugana” was the grape, but it’s Turbiana – then I was led to Trebbiano di Lugana, which then led me to Verdicchio Bianco. But now my tasting note seems to make sense: one of my favourite Italian grapes was hidden behind a synonym. It’s quite grapey and flirty on the nose, almost reminiscent of Fuzzy Peaches, and the French oak is well-integrated in the form of spice and bits of vanilla. There’s a fantastic interplay of peach, ripe citrus, vanilla, mocha, and cinnamon on the palate, while the velvety texture and vibrant acidity make the wine sing. Ace. Unbuttoning my shirt. Ian says that Vermentino is a grape that’s a bit schizophrenic, and that of the many Italian grapes, it’s the one that “aught to be in therapy”. I immediately think that I must be tasting the wrong ones, because all the Vermentino I’ve mostly tried are forgettable copy-and-paste wines with nothing more than a bit of interchangeable vague fruit. Early harvests, he said, catch Vermentino when it has a strong thiolic component, which results in a Sauvignon Blanc-like personality of mineral, passionfruit, green figs, and the like; a later harvest catches Vermentino with a higher proportion of terpenic molecules, attributing to flavours along the lines of musk and hay. The Argiolas 2014 “Costamolino” Vermentino di Sardegna DOC ($21) is full of apples, pears, and flowers. There’s a bit of residge which rounds out the palate, but the flavours are concentrated, savoury, and a bit saline. Along with Vermentino, Pecorino is apparently one of Italy’s most popular white grapes. Compared to other Italian grape varieties, the mountain-loving grape doesn’t yield as much, and its vinous fingerprint is expressed with Sauvignon-like aromatics like sage and rosemary, though from some examples I’m convinced that a hazelnut flavour can be an essential trademark as well. At first, I don’t get much off of the Tiberio 2014 Pecorino IGP ($33) except for some gentle herbaceous character among the citrus, but the palate is light-footed and bright with a bit of nutty and savoury character. I don’t drink Malvasia because, well – I can hardly find any – and because opening any substantial wine resource to the “Malvasia” entry is daunting, since its genetic permutations and varying histories seem endless. The Ronco del Gelso 2014 “Vigna della Permuta” Malvasia ($32) from Isonzo DOC is not as persuasively tropical or fleshy as many of the other versions of the grape I’ve tried, though the nose is rosewater-scented with bits of ripe peach, pear, and something dried and herbal, like hay. The expression on the palate is quite savoury, full of wet stone and salted lemon. The version of Malvasia used here is called Malvasia Istrana, and indeed Wine Grapes describes its propensity for freshness compared to its fuller counterparts. Greco is one of the white grapes that can be a little more tannic, being richer in polyphenols. The Quintodecimo 2013 “Giallo d’Arles” Greco di Tufo DOCG ($70) was indeed quite textured and expressive on the palate, with white peach and its pith along with juicy lemony dazzle. The nose wasn’t as revealing, with soft stone fruit, a hint of banana, and something along the lines of Mahjong tiles: something I also detected in the Tahbilk 2003 Marsanne from Australia. I don’t drink Greco as often as I should. Drooling, but also loosening my invisible tie at the price point. The dry wines end here, and we have two wines from two different varieties of Moscato: the Tenuta Olim Bauda 2015 “Centive” Moscato d’Asti DOCG ($29) made from Moscato Bianco, and the Donnafugata 2011 “Ben Ryé” Passito di Pantelleria DOC ($43) which is made from Moscato d’Alessandria (or, the more entertaining name, Zibibbo), a coarser and fleshier version that expresses more raisin, figs, and aromatic herbs compared to the fresher and smaller-berried former. The water-white Moscato d’Asti is a lot more elegant than a lot of the wines I’ve gotten to know in the same category, where flowers take centre stage rather than explosive fruitiness, adorned with mineral edges, a gentle wave of mousse, and limey acidity. The amber-coloured Passito di Pantelleria, made from dried grapes, smells of burnt orange, figs, dates, spice, and candied peach, covering the tongue in a caramelized and textured blanket ending in orange pith and just enough lift. <3",

At first glance, there’s something eerie and almost disturbing about her. I thought the books would give me more insight on Effie, but it’s the other way around – they did a really good job of fleshing out her character in the films. Like Effie, Rosé Champagne is a cryptic pink in a sea of others. Rosé is hardly even mentioned during any levels of WSET, so Champagne versions are even more peculiar. I wonder if the dash of hue is generally viewed as more extravagant in some areas – or perhaps it’s generally viewed as unserious, much like the opinion of the champenois on these particular wines. The wine had a delicate nose of mineral, flint, dried red fruits, and hints to autolysis that were generally more expressive on the palate. The acid was soprano high yet balanced, and the flavours were long-lasting. I enjoyed it, but it was almost too delicate for my tasting. The phenolics of the red grape skins in rosé Champagnes apparently bind with molecules that contribute to autolytic character; therefore, such bready and toasty aromas are deactivated. This explains my confusion over the constant breadless traditonally-made rosé sparklings. It all makes sense now! I’m still intrigued. There’s only one Effie but there are like a million more of these rosé Champagnes.",

And here I am reviewing wine, because number 1: I am crazy, and number 2: I miss wine. I miss wine. I won’t in a couple months, where I’ll probably be missing spirits. The Stump Jump is d’Arenberg’s entry-level white blend. I’ve heard wonderful things about the red blend equivalent (a Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvèdre) and I’m a huge fan of their other wines, so I decided to give this one a go. This year’s blend is 72% Riesling, 11% Marsanne, 9% Sauvignon Blanc, and 8% Roussanne. This is drastically different from the previous year’s (2010) vintage, which was 28% Riesling, 27% Sauvignon Blanc, 25% Marsanne, and 20% Roussanne. According to a previous label, it looks like the grapes from the previous vintage also included grapes from Adelaide Hills along with McLaren Vale; this vintage solely has grapes from the latter. I find this interesting – perhaps the Stump Jump is made for a rather good quality blend without trying to be consistent in terms of their flavour profile. Perhaps the non-Riesling grapes didn’t survive, or perhaps they’re trying something different. Maybe they knew I would obsess and did it on purpose to laugh at me. Who knows! The wine definitely speaks to its Riesling-dominance in its dry Australian form. Direct citrus notes support subtle pithy peach notes, and a bit of floral character and a balanced minerality add some complexity. Before knowing the blend proportions, I swear I had caught just a touch of a greenness from Sauvignon Blanc – but maybe that’s just the power of suggestion. The wine is not overtly complex, but I don’t think that’s what wine aims to be. The subtle complexity that is there, though, reminds me of a ray of sunshine on a cold autumn morning – not super loud or intense, but subtle and sort of pretty. As the wine warms up it’s becoming louder on the palate without giving way to a lower acidity. I’ve definitely been drinking wine too cold, too often.",

Sauvignon Blanc + Semillon makes for an interesting blend in their dry forms. It makes sense that the honeyed, tropical, and flabby-when-ripe botrytized grape is freshened up by the fresh-flavoured grape, but in their still forms, it’s almost exactly what you’d expect: a girthed-up Sauvignon Blanc with more body and less intensity, replaced by the neutralizing honeyed and soft citrus of Semillon. To me, the first blends that come to mind exist in Bordeaux, Australia, and Chile – although I’m sure I’m missing many more regions. In Bordeaux, it’s a little more elegant – more structure, with fresh herb-like Sauvignon character; in Australia, fruity, young, and soft; and in Chile, a more stewed and heavier character, with the herb-y Bordeaux expressed as the greenness more reminiscent of green bell peppers further softened by the Semillon. And that’s exactly what this was – and easy-drinking, soft expression which probably has the least amount of obvious green Sauvignon character than you’d expect of the regions I’ve mentioned (at least to my experience, so far). The guess of white Bordeaux was nothing more than a shot in the dark, perhaps as a shadow to the stunning White Bordeaux we tried a couple weeks ago that no one was sure what to think about, myself included. Ah, well. I’ve never liked the shape of these bottles, but the wine was better than I would have expected.

And I do say wrongly-hated, because it’s such a versatile grape: from the steely versions in Chablis to the big and oaked cowboy bottles in California, it’s such a shame that consumers wave it off. I remember helping out a customer who was looking for a Chablis – unfortunately, the ones we had were out of her price range, but upon helping her choose a leaner, cooler climate Chardonnay, the cringing “I hate Chardonnay” was uttered. Girl, don’t even. Although easy to grow, Chardonnay buds early, which means that this is probably why the Germans don’t focus on a regional expression, and yet another reason why Champagne is pricey. Chardonnay isn’t entirely disease-resistant either, and can be susceptible to powdery mildew, grapevine yellows, coulure, millerandage, and rot. A long list, but the amount of Chardonnay grown speaks for itself. This was a very good representation of Chardonnay – typical ripe green fruit notes dominated by the savoury butter, spice, and kernel flavours, with a heavier body, modest acid, and oak on the palate. Buttery smoothness despite the higher-than-expected acid, which is nice. I immediately guessed a Chardonnay from perhaps a cooler pocket of California, but apparently that would be too hot for this example. Even the Mâcon in Burgundy was dismissed as being slightly too warm for this example. After some narrowing of our choices, we eventually ended up in New Zealand – and here we are. I don’t ever recall trying many Chardonnays of the New Zealand variety, but it’s interesting how middling they can be – reminiscent both of the buttery kernel characteristics that you get in hotter climates, but still retaining a good amount of acidity.",

A bit of a contrast to the last wine in the flight which was the quintessential apple and pear-dominated Prosecco. This, on the other hand, had a marked mineral quality which sung more guitar arpeggios than guitar power chords. Further sniffs led me to conclude that it was undeniably very Chenin Blanc. It reminded me of a young and dry Savennières I had just the previous day, where the nose was all mushroom and wet wool with maybe some citrus, quince, and other pomaceous fruit in the background. Waaaaay into the background. This is definitely not your fruit-driven sparkling, and not even your autolysis-driven traditional sparkling. Though there is some yeasty complexity, you really do get that earthy mineral-dominated character which might be hard to translate into words at first, as it was for myself back when I tried this wine for the first time. Chenin Blanc is definitely one of my favourite wine grapes because it has such an anomalous range, and hardly does anyone ever expect liquid sparkling wet wool and mushrooms – and then enjoy it.

They may have cut that scene from the film? Originally there were simply three appellations for Alsace, and you may still very well group them in that way: there’s regular Alsace, there’s Crémant d’Alsace (sparkling), and then there’s the Grand Cru appellation which implies higher quality than the regular, but of course it’s still a subject of controversy. The 51 grand cru vineyards vary in size, the larger ones perhaps not being consistent with grape quality depending on the size and varying soils of the vineyard. Some producers jump on the grand cru vineyard bandwagon for easy cash, and some producers even omit the fact that they use fruit from grand cru vineyards because they choose not to promote the questionable status. Anyways, I really liked this wine. There was a lot of evolved fruit in this Riesling: along with bits of petrol, there were tons of ripe green and baked fruit, some ripe stone fruit, a bit of spice, and honey. Potpourri, even. The wine was so weirdly reminiscent of autumn to me, almost evoking some sort of Windows XP desktop background. Autumnal spice like wafting leaves, and high acids like brisk winds. Had I had this wine described to me before tasting it, I might not have guessed Riesling. There was a hypothesis by one or two in the class that this wine may have been cooked or stored improperly, though that’s still a process I’m still trying to fully understand. I agree that it’s interesting to see this much evolution in a wine that’s four years old from a climate that makes steely and long-lived wines, but it’s hard to say without much broad exposure. I’m noticing that whenever one of my posts ends with doubt, my solution is always to drink more of it. This is definitely not listed under one of the early signs of alcoholism (yet) so I think we’re all good. Hurrah!",

A great price, from what I can tell, but I’m not gonna pretend that I’m a huge connoisseur of Grand Cru Burgundy. Like, if you were to open one in my presence, I’d definitely force us to light candles and do a Gregorian chant before uncorking it. Pinot Noir from the Côte de Nuits, of the north half of the Côte d’Or, is said to be more structured, deeper, perhaps darker in its fruit, and have a protracted maturation window compared to the wines of the Côte de Beaune. So, compared to the lighter Savigny-Lès-Beaune we had just before, this wine exuded more dark fruits, more brooding notes in the form of forest floor, mushroom and leather, and some oak, where there were well-integrated murmurs of mocha and sweet spice. Undeniably pronounced on the palate, with intensity reflected by the high acid and fine tannins that were, for Pinot Noir, on the vociferous side. Feathery and elegant, but still commanding attention, like a starry sky uncontaminated by light pollution, Audrey Hepburn, or like an actual feather.

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma – Unit 3 – Week 2: Loire Valley] I’m straight up not the type of person to write home about Muscadet. The wine comes from the leftmost stretch of the Loire Valley in France, created by a neutral and fresh grape which can gain complexity from chilling on dead yeast cells, resulting in more texture and flavour. Its wines can often be bland and light on the nose with an old world monochrome template of mineral, green fruit, and hints of yeast. But the best examples, like in this wine, are much more expressive on the palate, with the yeasty, savoury, and bready components staging a complex dance on the tongue. You can tell that there’s much more texture which comes out in the viscosity and creaminess. Muscadet is literally like boring white bread. Do you remember the last time you’ve had really exciting white bread? Rarely do I come across white bread wines that veer into the very good category, but there’s an interesting yeasty complexity on the palate. That being said, one of my classmates deemed this as only acceptable quality, and in that moment, I made the douchiest turn and eyebrow raise, so perhaps this style of wine is not for everyone. Or I’m just a douche. One of my wine friends made the interesting analogy that Muscadet is like bubble-less Champagne: at the centre of the Venn diagram, they both have green fruit flavours, some citrus, high acid, and yeasty complexity; both pair classically with oysters. Though, they markedly have different textures, price points, and reputations – especially after really bad frosts cut production in 1991.",

This was the third wine in our six-wine flight and it was obvious that the first two were a traditionally-made blanc de noirs and a traditionally-made blanc de blancs. This class was all about sparkling grape varieties, so I couldn’t help but think this might have been a Pinot Meunier-dominated blend from both the wine flight continuity and the overt “fruitiness” that Meunier is supposedly known for. But on second sniff, mineral and petrol notes looked at me with keen judge-y criticism along with hands on their hips as they flew into my nose, and aromas of stone fruit soon joined the mix. Obviously not Pinot Meunier, obviously perhaps Riesling, but from where? There’s hardly any sparkling Riesling in the market, though Australia comes to mind – and Germany completely slipped my brain, since there are literally maybe like five sparkling wines in the public market in BC for sparkling German wines, and people don’t take half of them very seriously. Hence the vague New World guess. Riesling made sense, but the reveal of (Deutscher) Sekt made even more sense. The wine strikes a fine balance here, with Riesling character and sweetness balanced out by acidity and bubbles, with a nice stony finish. The flavours were uncomplicated and direct, which is really all you need for the kind of wine that pairs with “Love Shack”. Fun and bubbles in a glass, with a hint of the petrol from the Chrysler that’s as big as a whale, and is about to set saaaiiiiiil.",

Wines like this are great for the new wine drinkers – once the newbies get bored of off-dry Riesling and Moscato, this generally inexpensive grape variety carries tropical fruit characteristics with floral tones which are just as pronounced. I haven’t met a Torrontes that reaches amazing complexity, but it’s almost so hard to care with the matching inexpensive price tags. I’m guessing that its easy for this grape to descend into plonk territory. From what I’ve seen, at least. This city needs more of this grape, and more people to buy it. Acidity in Torrontes can be quite variable. This wine has a lower acidity which gives it a bit of a lazier quality and more of a Summer evening sipping kind of status.",

I’ve been home all day studying (and recovering from last night, for that matter) just to give myself an excuse to open something fantastic given I work through this fat stack of Champagne flash cards (which I did). So here we are, and I really wish I had a third arm that could possibly aid me in sipping some of this wine as I type with two of my normal human hands. Sex must be weirdly fantastic with a person that has three arms, but I guess it would depend where that hand exuded from the body. Are these the thoughts that flow through my mind with Auslese? Because I’m pretty sure picking out wedding colours comes with drinking white Rioja. Anyways, I decided upon this bottle realizing how odd of a value it was – $38 for an Auslese older than 15 years is a steal. Two years ago, we had tried the 1995 Zilliken Riesling Auslese Saarburger Rausch in class, which was deemed a good deal at $59. Though that particular wine was in a slightly different style being from the Mosel, it really puts into perspective how fantastic this bottle is at 38 bones, and it makes you wonder what the fuck is wrong with it if at all anything. But it seems stupendous so far, and maybe I’m just extra excited that I’m no longer fruitlessly attempting to remember the dates at which some Champagne houses were established. Oy. The wine. Dominated by ripe and baked pomaceous fruit, honey, and a present stroke of earthy and smoky minerality. A scoopful of the petrol we expect from Riesling but definitely much less than other aged German wines I’ve had. The palate is unctuous and full-bodied (I guess, sort of like me) – and it begins with a bit of sweetness but ends with a mini-streak of dry, spicy, and juicy minerality, almost bringing to mind an Alsatian Pinot Gris I’ve shamelessly poured into my head at one point. It’s interesting but less so than other Auslesen I’ve had in the past, not to say that this was terrible. The price is still a steal. The compelling sweet entry to dryish finish reminds me of the equally as compelling character with a heaping side of shady badassery, sort of like Cersei Lannister (who I absolutely love by the way – suck it), or Bree Van de Kamp. Because the wine starts off tasting like freshly baked apple pie and marmalade but then finishes by tasting like the stones used to batter you to death after you’ve littering the carpet with too many pie crust crumbs.",

Right off the bat, the nose is both repulsive and interesting – notes of charred meat and pungent spice attack the nose, with a balanced intensity and rather good quality on the palate. Fruit takes the backseat role on this one. At first I was turned off by the unconventional nose, but it intrigued me more and more as I went back to smell it. I feel like Pinotage is one of those nerdy unconventional wines you keep going back to once in a while. Wine itself can be an acquired taste – Pinotage is an acquired taste within an acquired taste. This wine in particular displays a great expression of Pinotage at a palatable price. Normally I scoff at ultra-specific wine-and-food pairing notes, but I honestly would be interested to see what this would be like, paired with some legit slightly-charred meat because this is exactly what it smells like.",

Much more charming on the nose than on the palate, where simple red fruits, earth, and a bit of flowers and vanilla were a bit more shrouded and quiet on the palate. Similarly to the first wine, there was a bit of sulphited character that was more evident compared to the other red wines in the flight, but it also could have been so because of the lack of intensity. Not really noticeable until we did a side-by-side sort of thing. Sort of like a faded Sinatra record, where there are hints of allure but you don’t really get the true magic of the grape. It’s certainly more characterful and better value than the basic Chardonnay we tried, in my opinion.",

So besides the Saint-Estèphe we tried just before, this wine was probably my favourite of the night. Despite the fact that my sickness dampened my smell receptors, what I got out of this wine was pretty damn good.  Classic Old World Syrah on the nose: dark concentrated fruit with earth, black pepper, game, and a marked bitter tea leaf quality – probably my take on the floral characteristic that got lost in the translation from the glass to my nasal cavity. The tannins were quite drying, but were ripe and balanced. The wine definitely had well-integrated structural components, a balanced palate, and a long length – and despite the slightly warming alcohol, this is a great value and a cheaper alternative to some Old World Syrah that might disappoint you now and then. The instructor was asked what sort of characteristics would make this particular wine be pegged as Greek as opposed to the Rhône – he said that he himself would not be able to tell, and that this wine is pretty similar to young and bold (northern) Rhône examples of Syrah. It’s a shame that many people overlook Greek wines. And it’s not like BC has a wide selection either, so I really hope selection grows (and attitudes change) over the next decade or so. Part of me regrets not buying that Syrah-Xynomavro blend that we carried at one point.",

      "description": "Jan 15-16, 2014 This past week might as well have been the boring one, because the next couple of weeks involve more birthday shindigs, UBC tastings, staff parties, and a wine lunch. This all leads up to the Vancouver International Wine Festival at the end of February, whose tickets I’ve hopped on like a giddy teenaged girl waiting for the early release of One Direction tickets. I’ve already squealed about certain wines and their respective rockstar presenters. Eeeeee! I’m legitimately looking back in my calendar to see if I did anything superexciting in the past week. I can’t really think of much, but let’s go through this day-by-day to see if anything fun comes up. Flashback style. I’m not always a bucket full of fun, y’know. Insert sparkly sounds here. Woah! Ahh. Thursday was my feeble attempt to make a wine tasting video with Chris.  I’m preparing myself for a cringe-fest (as should you). So lets hope for a painless two minutes woven together from a total of forty minutes worth of maladroit footage, if it even surfaces, which I hope it doesn’t. Oh – I remember that this day had an irritating combination of rain and wind to the point where umbrellas were useless, and jeans bathed in Vancouver goodness. But then I attended a beer shindig. So that was cool, and this happened:  …and we all agreed. Beer of the night? (Nøgne Ø Sunturnbrew.)  Friday consisted of work, but then some co-workers and I visited a friend at Tapas 23, which was awesome. This was followed by a run-of-the-mill work-filled weekend. I studied a bit of Champagne on Monday – basic stuff like minimum potential alcohol, the five main areas of grape production in the famous region, grape must volume levels, and so on. The flash cards have begun. The seal has broken. Then I made a lasagna and some apple chicken as per super chill recipes. I’m definitely not a natural cook, and I find myself tossing in random ingredients into dishes to see what’ll happen. Also, I think I hate thyme? And I accidentally snorted dried marjoram at one point. Whatever the hell marjoram is.  I went shopping for non-slobby clothes on Tuesday before work, and I have a checked box on my calendar that says “wash wine glasses” because I’m that boring. Also, I didn’t drink anything today – is it bad that this is so exceptional that it’s an actual event that I have to point out? WSET Diploma class on Wednesday was centred around the global and local market for sparkling and fortified wines (i.e. a business-centric class), taught by rockstar Master of Wine, Barbara Philip. Therefore, it becomes one of those moments where it’s so amazingly horrifying reading out your tasting notes and assessment conclusions out loud: it’s like grade school all over again, where you pray you won’t get called on. I got called first, of course. But I did well so insert Z-snap here. It was unlike me to not drink anything after class because spitting out wines teases my liver, taste buds, and sometimes my sanity. But I think I was preparing for a birthday shindig on the Friday after having made my liver cry on Monday. But it’s Thursday and I caved. How can you say no to hazelnut beer and Grimbergen? I normally could, but I woke up at noon and now it feels like 8PM.",

I don’t know why I think it’s necessary for me to mention that I moved onto my first iPhone, but I’m going to: I’ve moved onto my first iPhone. And I instantly turned into the person I thought I would never be – the person constantly glued to their screen, swiping down on every app just to refresh what might be minuscule and insignificant updates that other people filter just so their lives look more entertaining than yours. I’m making it seem like I’m much older than I am, which seems to be a shitty inadvertent theme anyways? Fancy dinner on some Sunday. It was great. I shall not talk about the accidental crunchy journey home because it’ll give you more fodder to poke at what might be my already hilarious life, but I’m still mentioning its existence because it makes me look mysterious even though what it should make me look like is gross. Also: the one night I really should have been an Instagram junky, because there were some fantastic (and surprisingly subpar) wines that were had that night, though I guess I was too focussed on unexpectedly breaking wine glasses and attempting to be a socially acceptable human being. oh no UGH THOUGH I felt like an incomplete being the next morning, as if a large chunk of my sobriety was smeared on the road outside. And my first thought was not “is my wallet still in my jacket?!”, but was more along the lines of “are my Bordeaux notes still in my jacket pocket and are they dry?!” and the headrush as I got up from the couch to check was not a good one, but all was good in the world, almost fantastic enough to make me sing praises to god and then make an irritating Tumblr picture out of it. And then I went out for Dim Sum with family because it was Family Day. Cinq à Sept on Tuesday at the Abbey. It was great, considering that the last one involved forever Gin and amaro. This time it was tame but with the busyness and crowded qualities of a swimming pool’s locker room during a hot summer day. Sometimes, “networking” is a word I hate a little more than “moist”. So thanks, alcohol. Why hasn’t Sia written a song about my life yet? After, a friend and I escaped to drink more wine and eat dinner at Merchants. And we stole another friend to join us over Nahe Riesling and weird manure-esque Salice Salentino. And sour beer things. That’s all I mostly remember, and that’s definitely not a good sign? Not pictured: sobriety Bottle share the next day. This included Sauternes (thus enabling the use of a stupid “You Sauternes me on” joke) and a vertical of Driftwood’s Cellar Dweller among other cool things. Untappd booster pack, basically. And my beer cellar grows faster than I consume its contents, so any excuse to bring beer to a thing is a good one?  Taylor on Thursday. And so what happened was accidental 90s night. I *just* missed the whole pogs thing while growing up, being part of the tail-end of the 90s kids generation, but I’m surprisingly decent at a game that requires aim even in the slightest because I’m literally the opposite of Katniss. Kerplunk was a thing (I don’t understand why I think you’re interested in hearing about the board games I’ve played in the past few weeks), and I haven’t played it since elementary school, where it was hardly played anyways because everyone stole the marbles. Also not in the cards: me being an architect. In the cards: me drinking cheap wine and still enjoying it.  I wish I had lots to say about the German wines we tried in class, but a cold has graced my cranium and I can’t smell shit.

Definitely one of the styles of Bordeaux that can drink now or can develop further. Many of the Bordeaux I’ve gotten to know can be a bit young at this stage. A bit of tannin can be weirdly refreshing after a while (sort of like finally getting to chew real food after drinking only soup when you first get braces, or something), but the tannin here was only slightly off-balance. Age can definitely round this fella out, and age can contribute to more complexity. Sometimes I feel like such a naive little kid saying that I don’t fully understand the big household name of Bordeaux.

It’s one of those things I’ve fallen in love with upon first high-quality angelic sip, but there’s really no one to open subsequent bottles with, and that much sugar in one sitting sounds like a recipe of caloric disaster. So I haven’t had port in a long time. But I think I’m actually trying to come up with excuses for having guessed something ridiculous like Banyuls, which, I think, would have been a lot more chocolatey, intense, and deeply fruited. But again with the I-don’t-drink-this-stuff-regularly card. I think it’s time for tasting study groups. Banyuls guesses aside, The wine seemed quite ruby-tawny confusing to me – partly because I need to recalibrate my palate, and probably partly because this tawny has only been aged for 10 years. At this age, we see less of the secondary and tertiary components and we see a lot more dried fruit components that are sort of ruby port-like. It’s like the dawn of the holidays, where you’re not sure whether or not you should agree with the radios for beginning to play Christmas music. But unlike the holiday rush, the wine was delicious and of great value. A couple years ago I brought port to a dinner party but the group (made up mostly of non-drinkers) preferred the Asti Spumante (duh). I ended up not opening it, but I did open it at home, drank maybe a quarter of it, and I’m pretty sure it’s still in the kitchen somewhere. Again with the study groups thing.

If old world Sauvignon Blanc reminds me of a violin solo with taut and delicate strings, old world Viognier reminds me of the cello’s smooth purr. Finesse and restrained charm is still there, but if lower pitches strain your ears less, then lower acid does exactly the same for your mouth. California and Australia also enthuse over the grape, but that’s where they can get less Bach and more Meghan Trainor. Condrieu is the classic area for Viognier in France, where the oily wines are balanced with finesse and more structure than their new world equivalents. The appellation only makes whites, and plantings have increased around tenfold from the 60s to the 90s, to the point where further expansion of the appellation is difficult. Gotta milk it if the world gets enthusiastic about your wines, I suppose. Viognier is apparently one of the most fashionable grape varieties at the current moment, but ironically it can sometimes remind me of buttery warm climate Chardonnay. The wine wasn’t amazingly pronounced at first, but aromas of stone fruit, flowers, spice, and hints of oak were found on the nose. Lower acid and an oily body were both typical for the wine, but a bit of finesse and pleasant phenolic bitterness on the finish added balance. What’s fascinating is that Condrieu is considered one of the few “great wines” that aren’t meant to age – though of course there are exceptions, with the “Burgundian” Château Grillet being the main one.

(Also stay tuned for guess-everything-is-2-years-old and shitty-at-length.) This was a wine that had a vague and almost insipid nose with a touch of that creaminess I’ve seen in some BC Pinot Gris, but still retaining a light, fresh, yet disjointed acidity. Much of the acidity seemed quite low to me at first, from what I suspect was from a lack of natural tartaric acid and instead, a front-mouth slightly artificial malic acid that was added to combat flabbiness. I didn’t catch it as much as other people did, but there was a slight funk on the finish which was suspected to be due to partial berry rot. It’s really nothing special, but it stunned me that this sort of pseudo-fresh wine was from Australia – I wonder if this is what some people think the formula for typical Australian Chardonnay is like.

It’s been a while since I’ve had actively had one. More than two years ago. (Ew.) Black cherry and cola are the main stars here, and there’s a subtle dried herby undergrowth on the nose. Sage, I think.

There’s a bit of spice and earth as well, and oak isn’t super gaudy on the nose. The palate is ripe and structured but soft, and ripe black cherry notes mingle with hints of vanilla and dark chocolate onto an earthy finish.

I’ve dabbled with a bit of Gros Manseng in the past, but the underdog wines of Southwest France intrigue me. They’re understated hipster twin grapes. Hello, Mary-Kate and Ashley! 2012 went down in history for the setting of catastrophically low (yet not necessarily low quality) yields in Europe, resulting in drastically lower exports in some areas, and lower quality in regions where viticulturists and winemakers played the parts of absent parents. So buying a pricier bottle of wine branded with a scarlet letter was already a risk, but curiosity made the cat drunk. So here we are, and I’m so glad you can’t see all the typos, spilled wine, and teardrops from back-to-back proposal videos and Project Runway. Both grapes in the mix are intrinsically intensely flavoured. But Gros Manseng is the much more vigorous grape of the two (let’s call this one Ashley), while Petit Manseng has smaller berries at lower yields, resulting in slightly intenser flavours of the latter grape (let’s call this one Mary-Kate). Both grapes need care in the winery due to thick skins (hence higher levels of polyphenols and tannins), but both grapes naturally contain a high amount of acid, easily enabling winemakers to let them ripen on the vine. This can lead to better levels of phenolic ripeness and the possible option of late-harvest sweet treats. These grapes are surprisingly easier growers, which means that my stupid Olsen twin analogy isn’t completely nothing. Yay! Full House, y’all. I’m a bit of a basket case when it comes to detecting oak (and TCA for that matter), but this time I’ve guessed correctly (!), with the wine having seen 6 months of fermentation and age in oak. The nose is quite intriguing with a spicy apricot sort of deal, along with a hint of vague melon. The palate shows similar flavours, but the fruit is overtaken by a wave of refreshing minerality, leaving behind a sand bed of savoury spice. The wine doesn’t hide its alcohol content very well, but it retains some level of finesse and freshness despite the expected fullness. The palate has acid, but it’s not the mouth-filling tartaric acid: a tart front-filling malic acid character adds a tangy sour candy sort of feel. The direct stone fruit character, minerality, and headiness are reminiscent of Alsatian Pinot Gris, but the bit of oak and acidity are different enough to leave a different sort of footprint. Now I’m deciding whether or not I should invest more tears onto online videos or sleep like a normal person. But I think I’ve opened that window after writing about wine at 3AM. On a Monday.",

Like the faux-sepia pictures of two Converse-clad feet facing each other, with one pair tiptoeing for what is obviously a kiss, and there’s a shitty “Love is patient”-esque quote on the front. Infinitely shared on Facebook by those friends who never seem to be single, but I guess there’s some happiness to be found in these things, even though they’re just cheesy photos with quotes that you’d find on a tattoo of a 16-year-old girl. I’m such a negative Nancy. Maybe I’d understand if I wasn’t so single all the time. Nah! But that’s what this sherry is sort of like. It’s fake depth. It attempts to be the wise and intelligent sort of sherry with nutty and oxidative tones. But the whole thing is sweetened up by PX juice in a way that almost detracts from any sort of nut character, and instead you get this ripe cola and fig sort of visage. It’s almost the other way around, where it seems like we’ve started with an unctuous Pedro Ximénez that’s been diluted with something else. It’s funny because I slightly tear this wine to bits, and then I feel bad for all the supposed grandmas that buy this and love it. I should start a program where said grandmas cook me yummy things and tell me cool stories while I supply the equally (actually) yummy sherry, and then post pictures on Facebook to make you feel bad about the fact that some random stranger is hanging out with your grandma.

I’m a sucker for anything(/wine) that has underdog status, so a pretty label claiming a traditional method sparkling from Argentina is definitely up that alley. Plus, I thought it would be a nice Peeta Mellark addition to the Katniss Everdeen wine I just reviewed. Huzzah? It fits. The wine has a surprising amount of legit autolytic character. It’s a bit more elegant on the nose, and I swear my red-apple-nose and green-apple-palate thing isn’t just a snobbish-sounding differentiation: the nose definitely has a more subtle but ripe apple brioche thing going on, but the palate has an slightly exuberant acidity that zips the colour out of the red apple and more into the green. It finishes with a bit of a citrus zest curtsy, and there is a gentle lacing of autolytic character and slight nuttiness throughout the palate. And I really hope I’m not just pigeon-holing my wines into character slots, here, because it actually really fits – Peeta Mellark is the baker’s boy from District 12 in the Hunger Games series, and we eventually learn that he’s sort of this artistic but slightly romantic and physically clumsy treat. And it sort of works here, if you make connections to the elegant aromas, the autolytic/bready nose, and the contrasting slightly clunky palate. This is a couple bucks more than some Crémants and some other traditionally-made sparklings. Although it’s slightly less elegant that some I’ve tried, it’s also easily toastier. Though I’ve learned to love my Champagne, I’d easily skip them for the frugal New Year’s Eve and go for this. If this is even on the frugal side. Maybe not. I’m currently in the middle of the second book in the Hunger Games Trilogy (Catching Fire). I thought the books would be more detailed, but it turns out the films did a superb job fleshing out the novels. Though I like Peeta, I probably identify with Haymitch, the constantly drunk winner-loser and mentor to tributes in District 12.",

Hey, don’t deny it. The hot region produces big and mouth-filling examples, but I’ve come across some Barossa examples that don’t seem as full-bodied as they should be, and I wonder if there’s a trend to break away from the typecast mould of bloated Australian reds. I’m staying right here. This was more on the typical side, with youthful black fruit, blackberry compote, cola, and spice flavours showing on both the nose and palate, along with cleansing acidity. Power over subtlety, here, and piercing rather than confounding. Not as viscous and muddy as some Barossa Shiraz I’ve gotten to know, but it works for this wine. Vibrant; intense; knows its limits.

Thankfully, you can almost always get away with reporting some form of “nuts” with sherry – then you have to work your way from there. I guess my nose descriptor of “nut dust” is a bit of a stretch, but at the time it seemed appropriate though I didn’t read that out loud for obvious reasons. Amontillado is essentially an aged Fino, which, from the blanched salted almond sort of baseline, gradually moves into the grilled or burnt almond sort of range. So you get a bit of a nuttier sherry than Fino without relinquishing the savoury brine characteristics. Typically dry stuff, though some Amontillado can be backsweetened with sweeter wine. Though I believe that stuff isn’t allowed to be called “Amontillado” anymore (i.e., that Alvear Medium Dry stuff which used to be called Amontillado). This shared some characteristics to the first wine in the flight, which was a Palo Cortado – while that one had a gorgeous grilled nut nose that wrapped around a small gem of briny salt, this Amontillado seemed just as expressive but a bit louder in its Fino-esque characteristics. I remember there being much more apparent brine aromas – there were some notes of “olive” reported by some classmates. There was also a bit more of a doughy almond pastry note along with a hint of a caramel-like aged brandy note. This was probably the most flamboyant in the sherry flight, with an awkwardly awesome sort of charm to it – very much like a jazzy number with a seemingly maladroit time signature which ends up being sort of cool. So far, I’ve paired sherry with Katy Perry AND Dave Brubeck, and it makes you realize how specific yet broad the subject of sherry really is.",

      "description": "It just feels slightly unfortunate that this seminar didn’t sell out – I mean, if the idea of Australian Shiraz is being purportedly tired, why aren’t we getting excited about every other fucking grape that can be grown there? Did you see Australian Grüner Veltliner coming? The answer is no. You didn’t. I mean yes – I tire my face out by tensing my eye sockets and resisting an eye roll every time someone says they “don’t like Australian wine”, which is somewhat fair considering that the market can be saturated with its own stereotypes. I suppose it’s just good business sense, but there’s so much potential past the generic back-of-the-bottle tasting notes that preach deep berry fruit, “smooth”, and an empty promise that it’ll pair well with barbecue. Bitch, please. But a handful of people raised their hand when the moderator for the event, Mark Davidson, asked the crowd if this was their first time tasting an Australian Pinot Noir. So it’s possible that everyone’s pretty happy where everything is and I’m just a combination of impatient and willing. And thirsty. So the theme is essentially anything weird or against the grain, whether it be international grapes grown on Australian soil or weird modern blends or whatever. Really attracted to the whole idea, and I think that this was the seminar I was actually looking the most forward to.  Not sure if it was the power of suggestion, but even after revisiting the Nepenthe 2014 Winemaker’s Selection Grüner Veltliner after having tasted all of the wines, there was an intense celery root and white pepper flavour underlying the leesy lemon curd. Arguably more typical for the grape than other wines I’ve seen from its regular home in Austria. I thought the slightly creamy body added complexity but it was mentioned how this was “accidental”, and that in future vintages they aim to make a fresher style made completely in stainless steel – there was some usage of (old?) oak barrels here that rounded out the more usual pointed character of Grün. The Tahbilk 2013 “The Tower” MVR is a 60-25-15 blend of Marsanne, Viognier, and Roussanne. A Dream of Spring, mostly, with creamiscle and gardens, and a bit of a nectarine yogurt thing bringing visions of an Activia commercial. The palate is rounded with some tang on the mid-palate. Fairy lights. The Grüner from the previous wine illustrated new wines that were produced from vines only planted not more than a decade ago, but this wine was chosen to show that even pioneering wineries are still trying to push the envelope. Madonna, or something. A woman in the crowd proclaimed that “that doesn’t exist anymore”, “that” being the irritating Anything But Chardonnay notion in the recent decade or so, as if the moderator had to issue some sort of a warning before people realized we were slated to taste a wine made from the terror-inducing Devil’s Grape. If only it didn’t exist, though – I still think a lot of people refuse to buy it like it has gluten – but the Shaw + Smith 2013 “M3” Chardonnay was fantastic, with a distinctively non-fruity nose that mostly brought to mind the burnt bits at the bottom of the microwave popcorn bag, with hints of spicy citrus zest and grilled pineapple. Fuller and creamy but with acid to balance out the scales, and much more savoury citrus on the palate. Just a splash of malolactic. Part of the panel discussed the much-used line that Chardonnay can do well anywhere, and that it’s actually just as finicky as Pinot. I’m inclined to debate, but I’m not a grape-grower, so I’ll shelve the thought and let it grow.  The Yering Station 2012 Village Pinot Noir from the Mornington Peninsula had aromas of ripe red fruit with bits of white pepper and pomegranate. Same fruits on the palate with more of a soft floral component. Perhaps too lightweight for me but agreeable and at least part-hedonistic. I’ve tasted the Abel’s Tempest 2012 Tasmania Pinot Noir before in class, but I’m much more charmed by it this time around for some reason. Much more complex than I remember, with lots of red fruit. The fruit is less ripe but more dried compared to the Yering, along with some spice, oak, and floral perfume. Someone I know equates Malbec to tasting like pen ink or new shirt dye and I definitely don’t blame him but now it’s all I can think about when I taste the damn grape. The Evans & Tate 2012 “Metricup Road” Malbec had this sort of inky asphalt entry with decaying leaves and asian spice along with blackberry skin and dust. For some reason it reminded me of a haunted house in the rain. Like mud and earth and dust and mysterious scrolls with fresh ink partially revealing clues to whoever murdered the blackberry merchant. I’m done. There’s this one butcher shop on my street around which I mentally create a no-go radius, because there’s this one particular spot that has a vent with these acrid meaty fumes coming out of it. I swear that there’s a hint of it in the Hardys 2012 “The Chronicles Butcher’s Gold” Shiraz Sangiovese (or is it just because I’m seeing the word “butcher”), but there’s also lots of dried herb and a dusty gravel sort of aroma that makes it more pleasurable. Lots of structure here, and quite drying. The Peter Lehmann 2012 “Layers Red” is part southern Rhône cocktail and part Spanish Tempranillo. Mostly black cherry, cola, spice, dried flowers, and literally, a bit of what my glass smells like after I’m finished with a particular oaken gin. A sort of sweet cinnamon-herb smoke? Tannic but finely textured, and a vague smattering of both red and black fruits on the palate.  I was mostly excited to try the next three because they seemed the most fucked up of the flight (besides the Grün, and okay – the Malbec). I was actually really impressed by the McGuigan 2013 “Shortlist” Barossa Valley Montepulciano – jellied but not jammy, if that makes sense? Lots of dark blueberry and hints of vanilla, dried herbs, and something animally. Quite structured at the end and some blood orange on the finish. A central Italian grape that I definitely don’t drink enough of. The Hesketh 2014 Barossa Valley Touriga had an interesting Viognier-like floral note of bergamot which was super cool. More spice, sweet black fruit, and some Froot Loops. Super structured like most things in the flight, and quite concentrated. Personally, the most exciting wine in the flight (and perhaps of the whole festival), and of course it’s not even available in our market. Yet. I haven’t seen this flavour expression from the Touriga-based wines of Portugal, from which the grape comes. High hopes for this one, for sure. I definitely love that the Tar & Roses 2013 Tempranillo is bizarre and complex but there was something I wasn’t completely into. There was lots of bold earth, raspberries, and tar, but there’s a hint of medicinal cherry syrup on the mouth that climbs through the chalky structure. I wrote down that it smells like someone’s house. I don’t get what I was trying to say. Of course Shiraz makes up the last wine in a seminar titled “Mod Oz”. What the fuck is so ~*mOd oZ*~ about Shiraz? The Longview Vineyard 2010 “The Piece” Shiraz is delicious, with hints of eucalyptus, cola, black fruit, and some soy and leather showing age without veering into total soy sauce territory. Pronounced chalky tannin and a fair amount of acidity join a viscous body, along with oxidized black fruit. 2 years of very well-woven French oak. If I remember correctly, the ~*mOd oZ fAcToR*~ comes into play because of the packaging which has a sort of street art Beastie Boys theme, and I remember hearing something about a sort of art competition they hold yearly for each vintage’s label. And a fascinating seminar concludes the wine fest.

There’s something about a classic-looking label with a pretty shade of orange. I’m so easy, hey? Plus, I bought a bunch of beer for cellaring and decided to go for the sub-20. The nose seemed very restrained to me. Old World coming through, perhaps, and any stone fruit character was restrained with an equal or greater amount of mineral character. There is a touch of floral on the nose, but the complexity ends there. Cool.  This wine ends up tasting like a stone with a squeeze of citrus, if not bitter citrus rind. Any fruit dissipates with the seemingly round and lively attack, and you’re left with a tongue-coating stony savouriness. There isn’t enough fruit to balance the minerality. Every aspect on the palate seemed rather unpleasant to me at first, but that attack is barely a silver lining. I can see a fan of non-fruit enjoying this, but even I find some pleasure in that area. It’s just not woven together properly.",

I’ve had the Aresti Syrah Reserva which was of good quality, so I don’t doubt the skill of the winemaker. According to Wine Spectator, grapes were harder to ripen in 2011, and wines produced will have been more elegant. For a region that doesn’t have as much vintage variation as, say, Bordeaux or Burgundy, I’m interested to see how a sub-20 wine like this might differ in another year. I will say that this wine is fresh and simple – a nice little alternative for Pinot Grigio seekers or for those who insist on a non-fruity wine which often shouts Old World to me, but here’s an example of one from the New World. Often, wines around this price (that I’ve seen) tend to lean towards the fat, fruity, and soulless on the scale of things, so it’s partially intriguing to me that this fills a different niche. The wine has a bit of residge that adds a little bit of complexity, mostly devoid of any intense character with a moderate stroke of balanced minerality as it finishes. (Some of my colleagues liked it much more than I did – not that I dislike it by any means. They thought it was from the Old World, which isn’t surprising.) You’d think enjoying the sun or studying for the WSET Diploma would be more suitable than tasting wine at 1PM. Eh. Well.",

I think it’s true – all too often wines made from Shiraz or Malbec can be made in a jammy, fruit-forward, and crowd-pleasing style with lower complexities. That being said, there exist Malbecs that aren’t just simple fruit bombs. I can tell Malbecs are still a little bit under the radar since my computer thinks Malbec isn’t a word.  I guessed the country, varietal, and price on this one quickly – but it may be heavily due to the fact that I primed my co-worker by mentioning that I was craving a full-bodied and fruity red. On the nose: ripe raspberry and blueberry notes, with a touch of that stewed sweaty barnyard character. The palate revealed a tongue-coating blueberry pie-like acidity along with a dense body and just the right amount of grip. This was well-balanced with a decent amount of complexity. The picky side of me kicks off points for length, although I would definitely buy this again. It’s interesting to note that this received 91 points in Wine Advocate.",

      "description": "Back to reality. It seems like everyone around me is getting post-holiday ailments but I’m doing my best to survive. The holidays were fun but thankfully, they’re never really over-the-top for me (besides last year’s Soave incident). I swatted all New Year’s Eve plans out of my view in favour for cooking myself a meal, drinking a bottle of wine, and sleeping at around midnight: and you’d think that would end up totally bumming me out, but I had a satisfying sleep as the planet fully rotated into 2015, and I woke up at a decent hour to do some wine reading. I’m riveting. I know. No hangover: that was a thing, though! I’m not the biggest fan of New Year’s resolutions, mostly because I don’t plan that far ahead, and because I think it’s weird to make weird and shallow decisions at some quasi-arbitrary time of the year. I tried to stop being an asshole in late August, and I mean – it didn’t work, but I also didn’t have to wait until January 1st, y’know? Plus, it’s not like I’m one to remember anything I superfluously claim at the beginning of the year, let alone most of the things I’ve done in 2014. I’ve looked through my calendar and journals, and holy shit: there were way too many things I did in 2014 that I can’t believe I don’t remember in a quick snap. But perhaps most of my instant memory is dedicated to remembering regions of Italy, or whatever. That being said, I can’t help but think about changes to make in 2015, and I did this whole sappy review-the-year sort of bit during the eve of 2o15. And it was great, really. At the risk of sounding like a shitty Hallmark card, I’m legitimately excited to see how 2015 will trump 2014. 2014 was truly a good vintage for the grapes of my soul. It’s dawned on me that the diploma exam is in 6 months, which will most certainly fly by quickly. It takes dedication and time to review material and blog about it every week, so I’ve decided to condense my posts instead of squeezing each bottle of wine onto its own page. It cracks my tepid heart in a stupid way, but hey: that’s life. January is the temporary calendrical haven for the retail person, but then the wine fest will roll around in February like there was nothing to rest on. Gotta take it chill. We come back to school this week in a class about Piemonte and Veneto. The instructors likely thought we needed a slap of acidity on the first week back just to wake us up from post-holiday doldrums, and so we did: we had two whites, the first which was a marzipan-scented Soave (Inama 2012 Soave Classico, $30) with creamy texture and intensity, appropriate to pair with a 90s slow jam; it led to the juicier and more lightweight Gavi (Fontanafredda 2012 Gavi, $26), which was more of a bright citrus dagger with flavours of lemon zest, apple skin, and lemon tea. We then had two flights of three: I completely blew the first flight, which were three different Valpolicellas that we had to judge in terms of quality: I thought the Amarone della Valpolicella was a Ripasso della Valpolicella; I thought the basic entry-level Valpolicella was a Dolcetto; and I thought that the last – which was the actual Ripasso della Valpolicella – was a Barbera d’Asti. Great. Perhaps my palate is off because both a classmate and I took notice of an intense acidity in the Amarone (Monte del Fra 2007 “Lena di Mizzo” Amarone della Valpolicella Classico, $80) that was apparently softer than we had perceived, though there was a lot of textbook dried fruit and chocolate character, all wrapped up in an evolved savoury and tarry leathery blanket. The basic Valpolicella (Masi 2013 “Bonacosta” Valpolicella Classico, $17) almost seemed off, with this sort of stinky decaying leaf sort of character but in a less charming way, and subdued black fruit and a lighter body also had relatively low intensity on the palate with tart fruit and a short finish. The actual Ripasso della Valpolicella (Musella 2011 Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso, $30) had a bit brighter acidity than I expected, with thunderous sour cherry, raspberry, and cranberry on the palate, which sounded like Barbera d’Asti to me, in theory. I thought that it needed, perhaps, slightly more concentration to balance the structure. Then again, I am just waking up. The second flight was much more straightforward, and we were told that each of the three wines were of different grapes but were from the same region: and so, deductively, it was easy to guess the Dolcetto as Dolcetto, the Barbera as Barbera, and the Nebbiolo as Nebbiolo. The first (Elio Grasso 2013 “Dei Grassi” Dolcetto d’Alba, $35) was an intense purple colour with plummy black fruit with bits of earth and an agreeable stemminess. All rather textbook on the palate with moderate acidity and chalky structure, with similar fruits on the palate and a slight lack in length. The Barbera (Ricossa 2012 Barbera D’Asti, $16) even vaguely reminded me of the wine in the previous flight that I thought was Barbera, with similar crunchy cranberry fruit and a fistful of acidity. Good value. My mouth is falling apart, at this point, and I can tell that the last wine belongs to the soul of a Nebbiolo, with aromas of forest floor, leather, dried red fruit, and wet leaves. Aromas and flavours are only beginning to shine through the thick tannic stained glass, though it’s still pleasurable, and still quite young (Vietti 2012 “Castiglione” Barolo, $98). Next week: central Italy. The acidity continues. Lastly: what do cats drink in Piemonte? Meows-cat-o d’Asti. I literally laughed out loud when I made that joke. More puns for 2015!

I’m rushing through these flash cards like a madman – a madman who takes a break every 5 minutes to watch internet videos he’s already seen five times over. But I’ve attempted to study Port and then I gave up in the midst of studying vins doux naturels – and then I felt sad somewhere in the middle and decided to watch the first half of the first season of Girls instead. This is how I deal with life. Reserva Rioja – not that I care to swan dive right into the numerical details, but the designation means that it’s spent some time in American oak. That’s where those herbal dill notes come from, along with the vanilla, which at this stage is well-integrated and sitting in the glass complacently. Red fruits on the nose with distinct red and black cherries, a bit of raspberry (and strawberry for that matter), a generous scoopful of earth (forest floor or whatever), and what seems to be a bit of stinky brettanomyces, but I’m not 100% sure. That beautiful developmental character of earth and leather is coming through. Classic Rioja on the nose, especially with that hint of soy sauce which I’ve gotten to know as a weird asian benchmark for Rioja. I’m used to Rioja that are much more full in body, but the palate still has an intense and ripe palate with a soft but strong and present backbone, hence the Oberyn thing. It’s that whole juxtaposition of soft and hard, or laid-back but powerful. (Maybe I’m just making this comparison because I for some reason equate Dorne with some pseudo-exotic Spanish-speaking country like, well, Spain, even though Pedro Pascal is from Chile but whatever.)

Neutral, but irritatingly so. We kept samples of this wine when we tasted other whites, and it seemed like this wine had just a bit more of a sulphited character (matchsticks et al) in comparison – though perhaps it was just the lack of concentration on the nose that made it more evident. I’m bad at picking up oak, but apparently there were bits of it on the nose, along with mineral, vague hints of green fruit, green apple, pear, and citrus. A bit of creaminess on the palate adds something fun but that’s about it, and we get the same monotony on the palate.

Originally I was supposed to put this into a flight with other traditionally-made sparklings (hence the small bottle), but I didn’t drink at all yesterday, and I’m thirsty. This made quite a loud pop and I’m pretty sure I woke at least one person in this house at 1AM. Jesus – I’m drinking Franciacorta at 1AM. I can’t decide whether or not I’m spoiled or desperate or a neat blend between the two. Where Crémant is the poor-man’s Champagne, Franciacorta and Cava are the hipsters of the European traditional sparkling family. Where Cava is the thrifty Value Village-esque sparkling wine, Franciacorta is the pricier golden find from the lesser known thrift shops or trendy consignment store. Sorta. Rarely do you see Franciacorta in this market, and rarely do you find anyone that knows of it (“you probably haven’t heard of it” –> hipster Champagne?). One time a customer came in asking for Franciacorta – perhaps simply wanting to one-up me on some knowledge – but then we ended up having a sweet conversation on wine. It was great. I left the wine outside instead of the fridge because I thought it would be warmer, but the wine is just as cold as the fridge in this current icy weather. The nose is lovely with ripe green apples, opening up to some autolytic characteristics along with some roasted and slightly salted nut tones, which is impressive for a non-vintage cuvée (or I haven’t been drinking the right ones). Balance is good, and the slightly autolytic green apple notes mirror the nose to the palate, ending with a beautifully roasted nut ending which has just a hint of bitterness. The wine seems elegant and light-footed with hints to its aged-tasting nuttiness. I’m honestly not sure how I would be able to distinguish this from its mainstream Champagne counterpart, so I guess I’ll have to do that comparison test after all.",

Even though this was a semi-blind flight, even someone new to wine could instantly smell the grassiness that was a Sauvignon Blanc. It’s a trendy grape right now along with Pinot Grigio, leaving Chardonnay and Riesling in the background – couple this with summer, and it’s a grape that produces wines that can fly off the shelves. Sauvignon Blanc isn’t a “serious” grape. It hardly ever ages, its character is dominated by primary aromas, and much like Gewurztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc is both pronounced in its character and is usually unmistakeable in its aromas, but with more mouthwatering acidity than Gew. Although I preach its distinctiveness, it has a range of emotion, from the restrained gunflint versions in the Loire, the oaked versions in California, and the greenness more expressed as stewed bell pepper and jalapeño combined with lower acidity in areas like Chile. So we come across this wine, and despite the fact that the class can often be split on identifying wines, I would say that the majority of the class guessed that this was from New Zealand. Not Chile, we said: too lean, green, and bright. And not Sancerre, either: too fruity. A wine like this was from the New World, and from a cool climate at that. It was a bit of a surprise to find out that this was from none other than Sancerre. The searing acid makes much more sense here – New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc is apparently softer in its structure. But the fruitiness is perhaps a response to consumers, who find that outward flamboyant style to be popular. Enter a modern style of Sancerre. I love fresh Sauvignon Blanc on a hot day, and its disappointing when you find one with nothing but at least med+ levels of acid. Sancerre can perhaps be reliable in that sense, but if only these wines weren’t so expensive.",

I don’t feel bad that it turned out to be the cheapest, but it certainly explains why these couple of young folks (couldn’t be older than 25) came into the store the other day looking for a sherry that approximated this exact one. That’s right – young innocent-enough-looking young’uns looking for sherry – for drinking. Sherry’s already one of the super-underdogs of the wine world, and it blows my mind that young people were seriously looking for one. But maybe there’s a hidden hipstery market that hasn’t been explored. I think I’m just optimistic. This wine is apparently mainly Oloroso Sherry sweetened by the likes of Pedro Ximinez. It’s weird because the two types of sherry seem quite expensive separately, and you’d think that perhaps quality would maybe decrease when blended, but this isn’t the case. For this one, at least. The wine had a pronounced grilled nut character, backed up by earthy notes of fig, mushroom, and a slight complex funk that all almost reminded me of an aged Cognac I once had. But if this partially reminds me of aged Cognac, then there’s definitely a Sherry that’s waiting to blow my mind. My mouth is ready. I’m not sure why I thought it was Madeira – I think it was the unfamiliar complexity that got to me, but the lower acid makes sense here, with the Palomino grape inherently lacking such things.

As last week’s quasi-quasi-quasi-quasi-bulk purchase of 400 flash cards (surprisingly) wasn’t enough, I went ahead and bought 1000 today. Of course, no trip is complete without visits to other private liquor stores in the area (that I’ve never been to) so why not? Go for flash cards, come back with wine. A mistake? Perhaps. Yes. A large proportion of my day was spent sitting at Starbucks and debating whether or not I should buy one or a combination of the following wines that I promised the sales clerk that I would return for after mulling it over: a 1990 Champagne (on clearance), a 1996 Barsac, a 2000 Barsac (same producer), a Blanquette Méthode Ancestrale (doux style), or a cold White Zinfandel (as much as I hate to admit: I was craving something like this. STOP JUDGING ME!). My ridiculous purchase of the Torres Jaime I Brandy last week (not to mention WSET Diploma tuition, for that matter) was enough to convince myself that I needed to chill out with the spending. I’m waiting to crack open the brandy as a celebratory Unit 2 test results excuse – but let’s be real: it’s WSET, and I’m probably not going to get my results for a while. Although still not the cheapest thing, I went with the Blanquette, since I’ve had the dry version, and because I’ve never had a “doux”-designated French sparkler. Also, it’s summer. The nose is interesting: dominant with ripe and juicy red apple, in contrast to the elegant greener and crunchier apple notes of Champagne, and it doesn’t veer into other tree fruit notes (say, stone fruits), which a sparkler like Moscato (d’Asti) can often do. Reminiscent of apple cider. The nose also shows hints of almond and an unmistakable presence of a toasty bready character, the latter which can disappointingly be absent from more traditionally made sparklings. The palate echoes the flavours on the nose, and almost ties in the individual elements: this tastes like apple strudel with almond flakes and hints of honey drizzle. Delicious. Varietally correct, according to Jancis, who gives the grape variety a short but concisely sweet entry in her Wine Grapes compendium. If the Loire was hipster, then sparkling Languedoc is the stuff that the stuff has never heard of. Structurally, the wine has acidity, but just enough to balance the medium-sweet character. The “doux” designation means that this wine has at least 50 grams of sugar per litre, so acidity is key. More zip would have been nice, but as always, the bubbles give a bit of a textural lift. Average length. This is one of those wines that is friendly enough to please those with sweet teeth but is obscure enough to intrigue the alcohol nerds. The price tag makes me sweat a little more than I should on a hot broke-collegian summer day, but sometimes curiosity and delicious obscurity is worth it. Oh, and royal baby.

Basic ruby ports like this one are basically chosen to mimic the fruity character of a young vintage port, but having a drink-now sort of sensibility. The idea is great, and basic ruby commands a fair amount of the port market, but this was sort of like the last wine but much less intense. Much much much much much much less, to the point where they’re only similar in theory and they’re actually not that close together in practice. The wine didn’t have quite the extraction, definition, or concentration to it, almost giving a faux-aged character with a bit of dried fruit, prune, and small amounts of sweet spice. But that was sort of it, and there just wasn’t much complexity. That being said, this wasn’t bad – and as I’ve said, basic ruby ports like these make up a majority of the port that’s consumed on a global basis, and at least port is being consumed for that matter. I don’t think Sherry or Madeira have that going for them, sadly. It’s like Valentine’s Day. It’s the Hallmark holiday that everybody loves to hate, but I suppose people are at least making efforts to spread love no matter how faux it sometimes ends up being.",

      "description": "I’ve unapologetically become my parents when it comes to travelling, which primarily means that I like to arrive at airports hours and hours before I realistically need to. Combine that with what Erin and I decided to drink the night prior, which was all of Cava, fresh hop beer, and bourbon. Why?! But the morning turned out fine, and we had shitty mimosas and beer at the airport to satisfy the unending ghosts of the night prior. The short layover in Montreal slowly eased us into our French-speaking modes, followed by a decent 7-hour flight to Paris. I sheepishly told the flight attendant that I would like the chicken option for dinner, which really just means I muttered “poulet”. I don’t remember what in-flight movie I saw, but after watching the trailer, I realized this might not be the time to finally watch Taken. Everyone always has one of these shitty interchangeable airplane wing pictures when they fly so here’s mine. Obviously filtered the shit out of it. Earlier in the year, when we decided to do this Europe wine trip on a whim, Erin and I had two stipulations when it came to deciding where we would travel: Bordeaux made us shrug, and Paris made our shoulders touch our earlobes. But the thought of separating Paris from our first trip to France was difficult, so we would attempt to take silly pictures with the Eiffel Tower and maybe watch tourists spend half an hour trying to get a perfect picture fingering the Louvre. Plus, our Canadian friend Theran currently lived in Paris, anyways, and he would be joining us for the bulk of the trip. So it was decided, and I took it as a sign when our first experience on Paris transit involved shitty (but admittedly entertaining) rap at 10AM which was more than any of the three of us could handle. oui As much as Paris ignited a forced montage and soundtrack (feat. Carly Rae Jepsen) of I-can’t-believe-we’re-actually-here realness, the first day was a jaded blur, starting with an awkward check-in at our hostel and then settling into our triple bunk, where Erin took the very top while I claimed the bottom. This was followed by a quick visit to the Cathédral Notre-Dame, a bit of a tour of the surrounding area, dinner at The Great Canadian Pub (yes: in retrospect, WHY?!), and wasting my travel data on Tinder. And so we slept like babies for the night. Our roommate had an odd combination of intentionally ripped shirts and early 2000’s cargo pants which really didn’t prepare us for the gentle distracting sounds that he provided during the night. I still think he just had a really bad itch, but Erin swears otherwise. Anyways, after some conversation (the next day, obviously), we found out that he was from Italy. And he really liked Bounty chocolate bars. Literally don’t know where this was but it was pretty soooo yeah I hate to be the guy that raves about the ~bEsT cRoIsSaNtS~ in France, but we legit had some good flaky warm ones the next morning and shared pastries next to some body of water that flowed through the city. We explored some streets and areas mostly to soak in vibe, and we also had a stupid aim of finding something to buy in Paris just so we could irritatingly tell people that we bought it in Paris. Then we ended up at Le Tout Monde, a natural wine bar which, annoyingly, we fell in love with. At first, Google Maps told us we had arrived even though it was a dark sketchy empty intersection after crossing a bridge, though weirdly, the surrounding streets seemed much more lively after the hours we had spent at the bar. All of the amazing and weird. We attempted to take tasting notes, but they eventually descended into haikus, and then single words, and then drunken aggressive conversations with Frenchmen. Matteo Furlani “Sur Lie Alpino” (Vino da Tavola?, Italy)\nGrapes of Pavana, Vernaccia, Lagarino Bianco, Verderbara: I hope this is accurate, and it makes me nervous that I can’t even find this last grape in the big Wine Grapes tome. Ancestral Method, if my research is correct, with no sulphites added. Hint of bruised apple and lots of white pepper and rosemary on the nose and earthy farmyard, but very open-knit and with a skein of apple skin and soil on the palate. Pétillant but quite textured. Not super long but with a ghost of minerality. Svelte and pleasantly slippery for a sparkling. Oh! Of course it’s sur lie, which explains the mouthfeel. Les Vignes du Mortier 2014? “Brain de Folie” (Vin de France?, France)\nUnsure of the vintage one this one, but I would bet on 2014 from research. Either Grolleau or Cab Franc (both?): my research is inconclusive because I can only find info on the red, but I swear this was a rosé. Rustic strawberries with a kick of well-woven herbaceousness (leaning towards Cab Franc but IDK you guys). Weighty and perfumed, with an echo of green pepper and strawberries on the palate. Rounded acid. More like a superlight red than a delicate rosé. Selene 2014 Beaujolais Nouveau (Beaujolais, France)\nRaspberry balsamic – lambic, even. Brett. Fresh palate, with even more evidence of something Cantillon-esque, with sprightly bits of sparkle, earth, and playful red fruit. Gentle but present structure. Château Lestignac 2014 “Tolrem” (Vin de France, France)\nMerlot. Brett, soil, plums, dark chocolate, dried herbs. Ripe blackberries, blueberries, and lush, like a warm blanket with an odd eclectic pattern. Chalky tannins and a bit hot, but amazingly complex and strange. Mas d’Agalis “Yo No Puedo Más XIII” (Vin de France, France)\nSyrah (50%), Carignan (40%), Mourvèdre (10%). Languedoc. Traditionally not allowed to state a vintage (though Vin de France is allowed now), hence the sneaky “XIII” on the label indicating 2013. Soil, blackberry skin, oregano, and meat. Ripe fruit and chalky structure. Simultaneously velvety and bumpy, and finishes tarry and ashy. This translates to something like “I can’t anymore”, but I’m pretending it means “I can’t even”. Yannick Pelletier “L’Oiselet” (Vin de France, France)\nLooks like past vintages have been vintage-dated, but the bottle we enjoyed seemed to be devoid of any specific year; same thing with a designation of Saint-Chinian. Hard to source down the grapes for this bottle but a faint internet grasp shows it’s probably based on Grenache, Cinsaut, and Carignan. A different sort of meatiness. Tea leaves and the vague description of Asian spice. Meaty green onions and dark fruits. Kinda cool and a ripe herbaceousness but strange and almost too weird: deserves time to be enjoyed, I think, instead of us taking on so many of these cool idiosyncratic wines at once. Cushy, intoxicating, ballsy, and fiery. Yannick Pelletier “l’de Rien” (purportedly Saint-Chinian, France, but that wouldn’t make sense if it was practically all Terret Blanc, would it?) [magnum]\nOxidized dream. Sip.\nOptic orange and nutty.\nSinks under the tongue. A tasting haiku whose matching wine identity escapes me:\n– “Brown sugar and prunes.\nBitter-sweet, raspberry leaf.\nAll oceans have shores.” I might not have even written this last one. All oceans have shores. Anyway, I go through this cycle of being enamoured with natural wines and then questioning the whole thing, but Le Tout Monde amongst other recent things have certainly nudged me towards the former, fermenting the desire for such places back home. Pun intended, always. Cue the next morning: our mothers would kill us if we didn’t take pictures with the Eiffel tower, so we did, albeit with a bit of a hangover. Check out this amazing cloud at this random place in Paris lol After discovering that the Champs-Élysées was not some sort of garden (as we had somehow convinced ourselves because we’re stupid), we explored the famous street anyway and I bought my one fabulously floral Parisian shirt about which I could shamelessly brag. Except it was from H&M, which means you could literally buy it almost anywhere in the world. Whatever though because I bought it in Paris. We visited the whimsical Ma Cave Fleury, which mainly served wines of the biodynamic Champagne house, Fleury, but they also served bottles of wine with similar organic or natural philosophies (e.g. Puzelat-Bonhomme!). It also happened to be something like “grass days” on the street, so there was astroturf everywhere, including long lawn chairs in front of Ma Cave Fleury, where we obviously decided to sit. If we’re gonna be sipping Champagne, we might as well do it on the most perfect thrones. Flight of organic and biodynamic Champagne, including a 100% Pinot Blanc! Fleury NV Champagne Brut Nature (Champagne, France)\nA blend of the 2006 and 2007, if I remember correctly. Beautiful gold-tinged colour, with lots of lemony citrus and red apple, sea salt, brioche, and butterscotch. Dry with delicate mousse and plenty of austerity giving way to more butterscotch. Interesting nutty centre amongst the lustre. Fleury NV “Notes Blanches” Champagne (Champagne, France)\n100% Pinot Blanc: yes. This is the weird shit I live for. Not super aromatic, but some red apple, a bit of nuttiness, yeast, and white flowers amongst the mineral. A little abrasive and hollow on the scale of Champagne, but with an apple juice-like accessibility and an earthy resolution. Fleury 2002 Champagne Extra Brut (Champagne, France)\nNot super extroverted and even slightly clenched. More doughy sweetness on the palate; sugar-dusted charms with soil and mineral. Definitely a combination of nutty, fleshy, and long. Lots to play with on the palate, here. Fleury NV Champagne Rosé de Saignée Brut (Champagne, France)\nDusty florals, cranberry, and earth amongst the elegant red fruit, which becomes much more explosive on the palate with more dried strawberries. Love! Erin and I obviously made the right choice splurging on Fleury before seeing Lady Gaga a few years ago. I don’t remember if those apples were fake or not. We passed out for a couple of hours back at our hostel (“…5 more minutes…”) before visiting the Montmartre, catching the tail-end spectacle of the Richmond Nightmarket-esque shops and the concert at the top of the hill. We were there mostly to get to Le Grand 8, a fantastic restaurant featuring organic and natural wines, which was suggested back at Ma Cave Fleury. We met some Texans who were discussing something about the appropriateness of one of their particular Instagram posts, and then we met Germans who talked about being German, or something. I don’t remember. We left early the next morning for the Angers, in the Loire. One city done; four to go! Avril Lavigne circa 2004 is playing in my head for some reason.",

And it all comes together to make this sort of promiscuous and young depthless thing. There was a bit of concentration and balance to it, though, so I’ll give it that much. More notably, there was a bit more fruit than the other sherries in the flight. This isn’t saying much because there was just a mere whisper more of some vague apple-like fruit which also showed on the palate. This sherry in particular has a bit of a market presence, moreso in the UK, so it’s doing its job.

It’s an understandable shame that most Merlot produced are boring ready-to-drink styles with insipid and vague red and black fruit. Only once have I come across a Merlot (that I remember, anyways) during my WSET Intermediate class that was coaxed into an aged, fruit cake-y expression with a nose full of juicy dark fruit and sweet spice – and from BC, no less – an area that can be argued to be a straight up shitty home for Merlot. I’m sure we tried an aged Saint-Émilion as well, but something remarkable that comes out of BC is just mind blowing. Wah wahhhh. Just kidding. This is a well done developing example of the grape, showing good concentration, structure, length, and those developing characteristics that can often be hard to find in a grape that ironically becomes the vanilla ice cream standard of wines. Dark fruits, plum, and oak share the stage with baking spice and a bit of that fruit cake quality (which smells better than it sounds), and the palate is appropriately voluptuous  with a med+ body – same as the Cab we had before it, but with a completely different texture. The label is cool too. Is calling it Game of Thrones-esque too much of a stretch? Among one of the first wines I tried in a restaurant was a BC Merlot (legitimately surprising) in a BC-themed flight of three.

      "description": "There was another set of seminars: I had to choose between a study on South American wines, the range of Riesling grown in Alsace, or the aging potential of New York wines. When Brandon Seager – the Chair of the Winemaking Department at Tompkins College, Winemaker, and Finger Lakes Wine Country LGBT Ambassador (cool, I didn’t even know that was a thing!) – used Brad Pitt analogies and pictures to explain the nuances of wine aging, I knew that I had chosen the right seminar. Huzzah. The wines were what I was mostly looking forward to, especially the aged ice wine, which can be quite a divisive topic when it comes to cellaring wine. Opponents of the idea believe that ice wine is best drunk as fresh as possible, as fresh as newly-fallen snow to emphasize the bright and concentrated sweet flavours that bounce in the mouth with flashes of glitter and brightness. But our example was wonderfully delicious, with bright fruit replaced by more caramelized flavours. Perhaps I need to rethink my thoughts when it comes to cellaring Canadian ice wine. Experiments are in order, obvi. Later that day, there was a casual tasting on the wines of the world. Brazilian wines? YES. Bring me there. And of course, I also decided to channel my energy into trying some Tuscan wines before the week’s conclusion. I needed some of that Old World Sangio in my life to balance out the week on New York Riesling. This will by my last post on the 2015 Wine Bloggers Conference, I think (phew!). I did count my tasting notes on the week and it looks like I had 190 in total, but I’ve cut it down to 133 due to some illegibility (duh…) among other reasons – which means, of course, that I’m skipping writing about some events. Which sucks! But it happens. A great conference, and I can’t wait for Lodi in 2016. “…and the worst. Beware of the Pinots.” Hermann J. Weimer 2008 Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium lemon. Aromatics led by lime, citrus zest, and lots of a smoky chalky slaty character. That moment between dry and off-dry; there’s more fruit on the palate expressed as zippy peach that dances on the tongue. Almost like hard candy. A bit shorter than I expected but still delicious. Dr. Konstantin Frank 2008 Semi Dry Riesling (Finger Lakes, New York)\nGolden hue. Jammy apricots on the nose along with chalk and a scent I can only describe as weird flowers. Medium dry and with fruit that’s trying to claw its way through the refreshing acid. Honeyed at the end. Hazlitt 1852 Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Franc (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium garnet. Mint and green pepper, along with dark chocolate, dried raspberries, soil, and a hint of soy sauce. Dry and velvety, bordering on the fuller side of things, with lighter slightly chalky tannin. Long and suede-like. Casa Larga 2005 Fiori Delle Stelle Vidal Ice Wine (Finger Lakes, New York)\nMedium amber colour. Blast of caramelized mango and a bit of smoked fish (this combination: Philippines, is that you?). Luscious with mouth-coating tropical fruit cooked in brown sugar. Long, and the acid doesn’t fail to illuminate the wine.  Salton Brut (Serra Gaúcha, Brazil)\nPerfumed with lots of flowers and peach; off-dry and savoury with creamy mousse. Salton 2012 “Intenso” Cabernet Franc (Campanha, Brazil)\nCherry cola with hints of herbs. A bit sticky but pleasantly soft and warm. Salton 2012 “Intenso” Tannat (Campanha, Brazil)\nEarth, dark fruit, and blackberry skin; quite ripe in fruit with slightly chalky tannins. Quite open-knit with fair amounts of glitz and glitter. Salton 2009 “Talento” (Campanha and Serra Gaúcha, Brazil)\nCabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Tannat. All of plums, mint, and spice. Very ripe and open, even unashamed and naked. Savoury. A bit over the brim. Villa Trasqua 2013 Toscana Rosso (Toscana, Italy)\nMostly Sangiovese with just a pinch of Alicante Bouschet. Though mainly consisting of dried red fruit, it’s very soft, welcoming, and smiling. Almost seems un-Sangiovese-like but not without a bit of Italian scratch to the texture. Villa Trasqua 2011 “Evoluto” Chianti Classico (Chianti Classico, Toscana, Italy)\n95% Sangiovese with Colorino and Malvasia Nera. 18 months in Slavonian oak. Mostly sweaty plums, red fruit, cherry, and dried herbs. Ripe fruit contributing to the roundness, with a substantial amount of chalky structure. Villa Trasqua 2009 “Fanatico” Chianti Classico Riserva (Chianti Classico, Toscana, Italy)\n100% Sangio. More spice, smoke, and fruit that tends over to the darker side of things. At this age it seems on its way to loosening the ripe tannin, but it’s still quite alive and ripe on the palate. Villa Trasqua 2007 “Nerento” Chianti Classico Riserva Gran Selezione (Chianti Classico, Toscana, Italy)\n100% Sangiovese; low yields, double guyot, and 30 months ageing. Gran Selezione: Chianti Classico’s relatively new designation involving estate fruit and 30 months of ageing. Here we go. There’s a concentrated purity of that sour cherry Sangiovese sass that I seek. Some spice and tomato leaf but also some nice balancing fruit sweetness on the palate. Chalky textural love. Yes. Villa Trasqua 2008 “Trasgaia” Toscana Rosso (Toscana, Italy)\nCabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Sangiovese. Sweaty leather, nuts, cooked red fruit, and dried herbs. Very much open, extroverted and with a velvety texture that’s balanced well with the tannic roughness. A pleasant hint of cooked veg on the palate. Villa Trasqua 2008 “Trasolo“ Toscana Rosso (Toscana, Italy)\n100% Merlot. Dark fruit, smoke, and earth. Ripe black fruits on the palate with a substantial amount of tannin. Savoury.

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma class – Section 1 – Week 8] Even after having had an identity guess for this wine, I still noted down a marked floral character from this. I had thought this was more neutral at first – perhaps it needed to warm up. But the floral characteristic with spice and soft expressions of stone/tropical fruit would lead this to Viognier. After having tasted the German Pinot Blanc, I was so sure that this wasn’t Viognier. Texture-wise, this is a much more fresh expression to what I expected – Oz Clarke’s verbal paintings of voluptuous fruit and enticing creamy notes lead me to believe that the Pinot Blanc was Viognier. Washington is the one of the last places I would expect this from – a calmer more mineral tone lead me to believe that this was certainly a cooler climate (and perhaps even Old World), but it lacked a bit more flamboyance than I would expect, although there was more intensity on the nose and palate than I had originally noted. Suddenly Washington makes sense, but I hardly knew they grew Viognier there. Viognier is a grape quite known for its phenolic characteristics: an example of a grape that maybe needs more care in vinification opposed to its growing, due to a common bitterness that it might have. This makes sense. I’ve hardly come across many affordable Viogniers that I’ve fallen for. Condrieu is on the spit bucket list. Although less loud than I had expected, this style of Viognier reminds me of some of the Pays d’Oc versions I’ve had, but better. The less impressive restrained versions have had that imbalanced mineral savoury bitterness without much fruit and balance. Australia seems to be pleasantly surprising to me, and is perhaps less of a gamble when it comes to Oz Clarke’s poetic descriptions of the grape – but this is just based on what I’ve had so far.",

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma class – Section 1 – Week 7] I didn’t believe it, and even during my first liquor store gig ever, I scoffed when this came onto the shelves. A Gran Reserva for 16 dollars makes the wine-savvy ruffle their eyebrows and go oh-please. This has to be shitty. Why wouldn’t it be? Put some fancy-looking Spanish words on a quasi-chic label complete with fucking gold wire wrapping, and it’s exactly like buying anything at the Richmond night market. It looks like it’ll be a good deal but it won’t be. The stingy are finally rewarded, and the skeptics lose a point. This is legitimately good stuff. And I know what you’re thinking – this has been aged for 10 years before it hit the shelf – of course and without a doubt this will have complexity. But there are way too many examples of good quality wines that fail to have the tightrope balance to last, and even with a lower-priced wine, it’s harder to trust it. Way too many wine drinkers think that the older the wine the better it is, but that’s not always the case – a misconception any person familiar with the subject will rush to point out sort of like that fun fact you’ve heard for the 53rd time and don’t care about. This can easily be sold for higher prices. I’m not too sure why it’s not – cheaper labour and production methods, perhaps. The wine itself was quite complex. The fruit was balanced with developing characteristics due to age, which also made it softer, but the red fruit was still bright and slightly candied, reminding me of some Barbera d’Asti. Nothing on the palate stood out negatively besides a slight imbalance in alcohol – otherwise, the medium elements blended well together. Over the course of the class, the fruit on the nose quieted down – an intriguing bouquet of dark chocolate and mocha took over, and then I became a believer. A gem for those who don’t believe that gems in the world of BC liquor don’t exist.",

      "description": "[Tasted during WSET Diploma class – Section 1 – Week 7] One of the small tidbits I’ve learned from WSET Advanced is that Toro is known more for their more robust and strong expressions of Tempranillo. A quick flip through my past textbook says that this is due to a thick-skinned clone of Tempranillo (Tinta de Toro). Indeed, this heavier-bodied wine has a large amount of that mouth-drying factor, although the sensation remains ripe since the acid doesn’t echo the intensity. Secondary characteristics reign supreme here, and even though the Valdepeñas Tempranillo we had before this had that hint of playful red fruit despite being 11 years old, the fruit here is very much bordering onto the drier, more serious, and even darker fruit territory. Here there is a little more black cherry, overt oak, and a nose so distinct of some form of smoked bacon that it was worthy of underlining. I’m not entirely sure I remember why I originally designated this as a lower quality. I was wrong anyways, and before you hiss at me for saying this bacon-wine was anything but very good, I should probably shield myself from the masses by just straight-up mentioning that I’m just not a bacon guy. I know. Stop it. I was, however, that kid who asked for a bacon add-on in his McDonalds hamburger how many years ago. I won’t be sticking pieces of bacon in my glasses of Tempranillo any time soon, but I need to meet that one person that actually is.",

      "description": "I don’t know what my point is. Amarone is great before sex? In lieu of it? During, as a suggested pairing that I’d secretly sneak into some conservative wine magazine one day? Maybe, if your sex consists of dark chocolate, Careless Whisper, and a comfy mattress. Which, let’s be real: Amarone is basically a liquid version of such. The northeastern Italian wine, a style of Valpolicella, is famed for producing sumptuous Corvina-based wines from dried grapes. My tasting notes usually consist of some kind of full texture, a handful of dried fruit, some level of chocolate, a variety of spices, and present structure that never tears the mouth apart. I’m tasting (almost) all of them at the Vancouver International Wine Festival (like I did with Prosecco, Nebbiolo, and Brunello), in order to further understand the scope of the styles. Hey: it might be chocolate-covered strawberries instead of dark chocolate; It Must Have Been Love instead of Careless Whisper; or the back seat of a car instead of a comfy mattress.  Allegrini 2011 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico $108\n90% Corvina Veronese, 5% Rondinella, 5% Oseleta; 18 months in oak; 4.5 g/L RS. Heady and spicy with coffee and mocha behind deep and gummy black fruit. The fruit is met with intense coffee bitterness on the palate. Mouth-filling but finessed. Cesari 2008 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico\nMuch more dark chocolate among the spice on the nose, but then counterintuitively certainly much riper on the palate than the Allegrini. Chalky. Solid stuff.  Monte del Frà 2009 “Lena di Mezzo” Amarone della Valpolicella Classico $69\n80% Corvina and Corvinone, 20% Rondinella; 24 months in 20-30 hectolitre oak barrels. Definitively coffee, and literally like that whiff you get when opening a bag of coffee beans. Within the styles of Amarone here, it’s the complete opposite from the Masi. A hint of well-integrated herbaceous character joins the mocha and dark chocolate. It’s mouth-coating and structured, but isn’t mean about it. Ended up buying a bottle to keep but just drank it the next weekend for a friend’s birthday, because I have no self-control. (Duh.) Cantine Giacomo Montresor 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella\n50% Corvina, 35% Rondinella, 15% Molinara; aged in Slavonian oak and small French barrels for 3 years. Moderately intense spice and lots of dried cherry fruit, maybe even some strawberry here; not one of the intensely serious noses in this lineup. Not so thick or overly expressive on the palate, either – just a bare drizzle of chocolate over cherry and strawberry. Medium-bodied. Cantina Valpolicella Negrar 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico $48\n70% Corvina, 15% Corvinone, 15% Rondinella; 8.0 g/L RS; aged in 225 hectolitre and 50 hectolitre barrels of French oak for 18 months. First bottle corked! A fresh bottle revealed smoky dried red fruit and spice. Medium-bodied, ripe, and soft, but deceivingly tannic. A bit of vanilla. Cantina Valpolicella Negrar 2011 Amarone della Valpolicella Organic\n70% Corvina, 15% Corvinone, 15% Rondinella; 8.6 g/L RS; aged in 50 hectolitre Slavonian oak casks for 40 months. Simultaneously gamier and sluttier. More ash and meat compared to the previous bottle, also with more sweetness. Similar structure as well, but maybe a pinch less tannin. Hint of dried flowers. Pasqua 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella\nAged in small oak barrels for 18-20 months. Vanilla-scented; obvious but well-integrated oak, here. Spice, hints of mocha, black fruit, dark chocolate, leathery. Quite mouthfilling on the palate, and with lots of tannin to chew on. Tenuta Sant’Antonio 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella Selezione Antonio Castagnedi\n70% Corvina, 20% Rondinella, 5% Croatina, 5% Oseleta; 6.8 g/L RS; aged in 500-L new French oak for 24 months. Mocha, earth, dark chocolate, some gummy black and red fruit. Definitely verging on off-dry territory. Medium-bodied with some grip, though it’s one of the lightest so far. A bit sweet. Tenuta Sant’Antonio 2011 Amarone Della Valpolicella Campo Dei Gigli\n70% Corvina, 20% Rondinella, 5% Croatina, 5% Oseleta; 3.9 g/L RS; aged in 500-L French oak for 3 years. Something spicy and velvety joins cherry compote. Medium-bodied, and notable spice and dashes of leafiness on the palate. Some grip, but rather soft and accessible for the most part. Long. Tedeschi 2011 Amarone della Valpolicella $56\n30% Corvina, 30% Corvinone, 30% Rondinella, 10% Rossignola, Oseleta, Negrara, Dindarella; 5 g/L RS; aged in Slavonian oak for 3 years. Stinkier, gamey, open, and fruity – could easily be a Masi brother. Playful red fruit, like dried cranberries and strawberries. Palate is also strawberry-flavoured, and generally structured with a hint of bitterness on the palate to balance out all of the ripeness. Tommasi 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico $61\n50% Corvina Veronese, 15% Corvinone, 30% Rondinella, 5% Oseleta; aged in 35-hectolitre Slavonian oak for 30 months. Chocolate-covered plums and dried fruit, and then something like dried banana peel and spice. Finessed and creamy; something in here is reminiscent of a smoothie. Tannins are there but it’s not super structured. Zenato 2011 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico \n80% Corvina, 10% Rondinella, 10% Oseleta; oak-aged for 36 months. Gummy dark fruit, spice, and obvious oak. An odd dried banana thing going on. It’s all of big, spicy, ripe, friendly and open with flavours of black fruit and oak spice. Rather soft for the style. Bit of meat and mocha on the palate. Zenato 2009 Amarone Riserva Sergio\n80% Corvina, 10% Rondinella, 10% Oseleta; aged in 75 hectolitre Slavonian oak barrels for 48 months. Probably the most aromatic, slutty, and flamboyant of all the Amarone I’ve tasted. Molten chocolate, black cherry compote, spice, and hints of meat. Something ripe and leafy. Off-dry with creamy texture and powedery tannin. Sumptuous. Domini Veneti 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella Classico\n70% Corvina, 15% Corvinone; 15% Rondinella; 8.0 g/L RS; aged in 50-hectolitre Slavonian oak barrels for 24 months. Lots of spice and forest floor here with black pepper and black fruit. Off-dry and velvety but with a hint of balanced bitterness. Solid. Zonin 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella\n60% Corvina, 35% Rondinella, and 5% Molinara; aged in 792 gallon Slavonian oak barrels for 24 months. Chocolatey, but certainly blackberry-forward. Very fragrant, full, and hedonistic. Charming and sweet, and definitely not so tannic. Alcohol is lower than the norm for Amarone, at 14% (for the 2011 vintage, at least): not completely fermented to dryness? Bolla 2009 Le Origini Amarone della Valpolicella Riserva\n75% Corvina and Corvinone, 25% Rondinella; aged for 12 months in French oak barrels and then 36 months in Slavonian oak. Red fruit, yes, but also a hint of something sweaty and nutty. Chocolatey, mouth-coating but well-contained. Quite spicy. 16.7% ABV. Bottega 2012 Amarone della Valpolicella\nAgain with a gamy version here, though moderately intense. Gummy dark fruit. Med+ body but finessed. Definitely strucured but not super grippy; more finely-textured tannins compared to most. Hint of ashy mocha.",

Classic Chilean dark fruit with green pepper characteristics always please me, but my one pet peeve with heavy grape varieties is an atypical, lighter body. That’s just me. There are people out there who want the nose of a Cab with a lighter body. You’re allowed to want these things – hell, I ordered a special hot dog a couple weeks ago and ordered two different sides with a half portion of each. But yes – the palate is lighter than expected, and the tannins than are slightly lighter than expected as well. The palate is fruity, and a touch savoury. A low but noticeable amount of residual sugar makes me stroke my wine-stained chin, but I understand why it’s there. This is not a top-notch wine, but it definitely caters to a certain crowd – I mean, you have the wines than bridge drinkers from whites to reds or Old World to New World but this wine bridges the gap between lighter wine and big boy Cab – and this wine is somewhat of a baby Cab. Although clearly attempting to appeal to a mass audience, I’m still impressed with the typical nose – some mass audience-intentioned wines can often be devoid of any character.",
